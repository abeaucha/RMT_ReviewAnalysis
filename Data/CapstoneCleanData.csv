"The first time I started dining here was due to summerlicious. My friends and I all loved their summerlicious menu. Everything they serve was absolutely delicious. The flavours were just right and the steaks were perfectly cooked. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside yet juicy on the inside. The pan seared trout was nicely seasoned and not overcooked. As for dessert it was alright. Service was excellent. Visited this place a few times after that and even held my birthday party here. Food was alright but not as good as my summerlicious experience. We had a semi private table closer to the back of the restaurant. Service was still good. My friends brought a cake to cut there and there was a cake cutting fee. Forgot how much though. During my other visits, some of the things that stood out the most is the butter chicken. The butter chicken (16.95) is one of the best I've tried. It tasted rich and flavourful. I seemed very authentic. It was so good that my brown friend even thought it was really authentic for a restaurant that doesn't specialize in this type of cuisine. Portion size of it was pretty small though. The chicken carbonara ($19.99) was not that good. It wasn't as flavourful as expected. Seemed like something was missing. Lobster sirloin - I think it was a 7oz sirloin with lobster bits, mash potatoes and veggies. Not worth it. Felt like it was overprice. It was topped with really little lobster bits for an extra i think $8. You're better off going with a regular sirloin for cheaper. Peppercorn steak ($34.95) - 11oz New York steak. This one was okay but nothing special. A little overcooked. The sauce was good though.The decor is pretty simple and the lighting is pretty dim. It's pretty good for a romantic date. Washrooms are located upstairs. The washrooms nice and clean. Overall, okay place. Something's are reasonably priced but others are a little overpriced for the portion they give.",4.0,2017-03-19,Yelp
"Attended a winterlicious lunch. $18 for 3 courses. I ordered, and enjoyed:Tuna TostadasSteak Bibimbap. (steak slices are pretty obvious. the bibimbap component was ok. Could have used more sauce. This handily beat my expectations of mediocrity)Toffee Cake w Vanilla ice cream(Shrimp Ravioli was good too. It comes with a piece of shrimp on top of each of the 4-5 pieces of ravioli)Simple and good. The prices were quite reasonable.I probably wouldn't rush back outside of winterlicious, because I prefer ethnic restaurants.However, I would return for happy hour, considering it was pretty great during the yelp event which was hosted here a couple of years ago",3.0,2017-01-31,Yelp
"I've been meaning to come to Reds for sometime. Well reviewed and recommended in circles around the office. Often used by colleagues for lunch time office celebrations...birthdays, seasonal celebrations etc. I was a bit nervous because I'm more of a slow, intimate, quite kind of a diner. Less of a steakhouse, loud music kind of a guy. Some of that might be because I'm a vegetarian. The setting was intimate, gentle lighting. Music a touch loud for my delicate constitution but hey, 80's music is always a winner. The food was above, way above expected. Garden salad, truffle fries to start and there was the flash back to Tuscany. My partner had the salmon dish, fingerling potatoes with heirloom carrots and snow peas. 11 out of 10. I had the vegetarian, vegetable fricasee. Delicious, perfectly cooked and bursting in flavour if not a little too busy with the aforementioned flavours. 9.5/10Apple pie with cheddar, outstanding. Espresso delicious. Staff professional, friendly and attentive. What else can be said? Shout out to Felix the waitstaff for making the visit memorable.",4.0,2017-01-24,Yelp
"As a young barrister  I often visited Red's older, fancier sibling further downtown. Now a seasoned public servant I prefer things a bit more casual, a bit less expensive, and a lot less pretentious. While Yonge and Gerrard is hardly ""midtown"" in my book, this Reds outpost has managed to downscale somewhat while keeping food quality high and prices at the upper end of affordable. The room itself is huge; taking up a quadrant of the Aura condo behemoth. Decor is standard vague industrial; poured concrete and reclaimed wood and exposed metal. Nothing we haven't seen before, but done to reasonable effect here. There are a few odd design flourishes: a (non-working) retro cigarette vending machine at the front, and back-lit curios throughout filled with tchatchkes like sunglasses and lighters and keychains. I'm deducting half a star for inconveniently-located washrooms. Unless you nab the accessible unisex guy on the main floor (in plain view of everyone-HEY MA!!! LOOK!!! I'M GONNA PEE!!!) you're running up a few flights of stairs and through a busy alcove. I'll take another quarter-star for the mix of seating. Dining with a small party, we get comfy chairs on tables. As part of an office party, we are directed to a horseshoe of high stools around an elbow-level counter. Let me be clear: I hate the whole high-stool thing. I hate not being able to comfortably slide my chair into dining position under the table. I dislike feeling like I'm teetering during my meal, and while I'm hardly short, I resent feeling like I need a boost to sit in my high chair. This particular seating arrangement also puts one far enough away from the diner directly across from you that you can't make out a goddamn word. The last half-star I deduct is for wait times. Reds proudly proclaims it's a scratch kitchen, which is admirable. At lunch hour, it's a liability. I've never been during a work emergency, but if I did I'd be back on my horse to the office before I even received my menu. I imagine Reds is designed with local office workers in mind...so a few quicker options would be helpful.It's hard to find fault with the food itself. A luncheon steak frites arrives hot and done to a perfect char outside with a bleeding medium.rare heart. The potatoes are a cooked  few shades beyond amber, and shatteringly crisp. I could do without the gratuitous bitter raw greens, which I suspect are meant as garnish...I just usually eat everything on my plate (see: mint leaves at dessert). A return visit yields tender butter chicken, a bit spicier than expected (I usually expect the Indian equivalent of Big Mac Sauce) sided with rice and naan. I'd gladly trade one of the starches for a second veggie curry-saag paneer or chana masala or even roald daal. As it is, the only veg in the house is a fair bit of coarsley chopped onion. There are also appetizers; fries and dips, and beet hummus (which tastes better than it sounds, but is unremarkable). A warm, custom-baked apple pie with ice cream is the highlight. Coffee is strong and refilled frequently. Sometimes, a little bit downscale is just right.",4.0,2017-01-10,Yelp
"I came here for dinner and had wine and entrees. I wish they have nicer sitting areas that are more comfortable. However, the wine, fish and steak were all nice. The salmon was one of the best I've had. It had a really nice crispy crust that is similar to pork rinds. My only complaint is that one of the servers kept walking by giving me dirty looks. Doesn't she get treated out? Sucks to be her. My server was also the bartender. He was professional and prompt 88% of the time.",3.0,2016-12-27,Yelp
"I had to try out Reds for Summerlicious! It was a 3 course lunch for $18. This was a very large restaurant with abundant seating, no reservation needed at the time. We were delightfully seated outside on the courtyard patio.For appetizers, we had the tuna tostadas and crunchy Asian slaw. Both were very good. Great portion on the salad!I ordered the Curry and it came with some fresh veggies, naan, and rice. This dish was ok, not flavourful enough. It was unpleasant to find some pieces of crunchy rice. I wouldn't order it again. The dessert was a strawberry cheesecake in a mason jar. This was excellent, I enjoyed the simplicity of the dish: a layer of strawberry topping, cheesecake-like filling and graham cracker crust at the bottom. It tasted delicious.The servers constantly refilled our glasses of water and they were friendly. We waited a bit longer than usual for our food to arrive.By the end of the meal, we were stuffed. It was nice to try, dessert was definitely my favourite part.",3.0,2016-07-12,Yelp
Their gin and tonic nights are amazing and come in the proper big fish-bowl like glasses served with garnishing appropriate for the type of gin you order. The patio sits right amongst a relatively high traffic area which can be distracting but great if you want to be seen.,4.0,2016-07-29,Yelp
"Second time here. First time they informed me late that the one i ordered is out of stock so they had me ordered again and gave it for me. But all my friends are done and just about to eat. Now, i ordered a medium well steak and my friend ordered a medium rare steak. They interchanged it, so i have mine be cooked again, when they gave it to me. It was burned (see pic)",1.0,2017-03-10,Yelp

"Reds is a stable of college park area, catering to many events and dinner parties. Having been there multiple times and sampling most of the menu, here is what I think of it after all these visits.The good: The interior! Reds interior is both beautiful and inviting. It's trendy look is definitely on par with high end dining spaces such as Joey's and Cactus club. It features both a nicely lit interior and also a patio area right outside on Yonge street. The gin & tonic selection is also something to rave about, offering creative options that are both delicious and out of the ordinary. Appetizers are also great sharables with great flavour, offering bold flavour that is a great start to a meal. My favourites are the sticky ribs and the lettuce cups.The bad: Quite recently, the best appetizers on the menu are nowhere to be found. Instead, the newly offered appetizers is just a small set (and quite frankly typical) of appetizers that is offered at any restaurant. Furthermore, Reds used to be a prime location for quality steaks at a good price point. Unfortunately, they've increased the price slightly, putting it in the range of every other wine bars. For what it's worth, the steaks are cooked well.The ugly: On my last visit, either our order was backlogged, or it was simply forgotten. It took an extremely long time to receive the main course. While the waitress was attentive to our order, there should be no reason that it takes over 40 minute plus for our order, despite semi filled restaurant.Here's the thing about reds...it is respectable chain restaurant that serve fantastic appetizers and drinks while focuses on offering a great experience. But it simply does not exceed beyond all the other restaurants of this calibre. While they were something special at one point, they've simply conformed to the status quo.",3.0,2016-06-17,Yelp
"Went last night with a table of 14 for a birthday party. Service was decent and we enjoyed the atmosphere. We also sat at their U shaped table which was pretty cool, we could walk to the middle and talk to each other without being in the way of other customers or servers. The food on the other hand, not so great. I ordered the three course meal for $32 and picked the mushroom soup w/truffle oil, 7 Oz sirloin with the apple pie for dessert. Those of us that got the soup all agreed that it was bland. I was trying to play it safe by asking for my steak to be cooked rare but my steak came out medium. The apple pie crust was delicious but I found the apples in the pie a bit sour for my liking. My girlfriend had the Caesar salad, salmon for main and brownie for dessert. The salmon  was surprisingly moist and the skin was nice and crispy, definitely a good choice. Although she loves chocolate... she couldn't finish her brownie cuz it was too sweet. I wouldn't recommend eating there but nice place to just grab drinks and hang out with friends.",3.0,2017-03-19,Yelp
"Just arrived in to Toronto this evening for one night. Not sure what to eat so I took a walk since i was sitting down for the last 8 hours. Using my Yelp app I came across Reds. Lots of choices in the area. Can only say I made the right choice. Great decor, lighting, music in the background and great staff. See below. As a self proclaimed Margarita snob it's not often I have a Margarita worth recommending. Kudos to Adaina for a great drink. I went for a light meal, the Lobstah Guacamole appetizer with a double on the Guac!  Make time to visit Reds when in Toronto.Adaina Bar Manager Greg Bartender",4.0,2016-11-15,Yelp

"The atmosphere is really nice for an affordable restaurant. The chicken tacos dish was smaller than you would think (it was cheap though), but it was decently filling with the loaded baked potato and was pretty tasty.

"Really great atmosphere, good service, mediocre food. I was here with some co-workers for lunch today, and the cool rustic decor (check out the chandelier made out of wine bottles and glasses!) and friendly hostess/servers gave me high hopes that the food would be just as great. Sadly, that was not the case. The five of us shared the steamed edamame and tavern butcher board. Both appetizers were good, but nothing too memorable. I ordered the Oscar Sirloin for my entree because it sounded amazing (steak topped with lobster, crab & shrimp, sauteed in tabasco butter, hollandaise sauce and chives), but it was pretty underwhelming. I had asked for it medium rare, and it was more on the medium well side, and a little too charred for my liking. The seafood that came with it wasn't very fresh and tasted inconsistent (some bites were really salty and fishy, others weren't). The side of mash potatoes were decent and tasted pretty good with the hollandaise. The tabasco butter gave everything a bit of a spicy kick. Definitely won't be rushing back for their food, but it seems like a fun place to catch up with friends over drinks and apps!",3.0,2015-11-05,Yelp
"Who is the chef, really? I had an excellent dish of Butter Chicken Bowl. It comes with naan bread and basmati rice. My fiancé loved his Chicken Tacos and baked potato side, as well. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable with nice decor. There is a large variety of food and drink options, ranging from salads, sandwiches, chicken, steak and fish. The prices seem reasonable. The wait staff are professional. It seems like a great place to meet up with friends for food or drinks; or watch some games on TV or hang out with your special someone.

We visited Toronto for a baseball game in the summer of 2016. A friend recommended Reds to us and we were so pleased. The food was fantastic- I had the roasted pork tenderloin. I never eat pork when I'm out because it is often too dry. This pork loin was prepared perfectly! Our server was wonderful. We plan on returning on our next trip to Toronto!,5.0,2017-01-13,Yelp
"Living in the area, I would consistently walk by this place on a daily basis, and would always admire their patio :p So, for my birthday, I decided to dine here. Ps- i give it a 4.5!Got a nice, cushioned patio seat, with a huge umbrella to protect from any rain/sun, and a barrier of flowers and plants to provide some privacy from people walking by on the street.  Decided to opt out of getting an app, solely because I wanted to enjoy my main, and I knew I'd be getting dessert on the house, which obviously I wanted to save room for  First we got our drinks, I ordered a maple bacon bourbon; a lot stronger than I anticipated!  Cost $12. For mains, I ordered the pork tenderloin with gnocchi, and my boyfriend chose a peppercorn steak with a side of mashed potatoes.  We also split a tiny side of fries. We waited a reasonable amount of time for our food to come, nothing below or above average. The quantity of food for me was perfect. Just enough so I could finish it all and not be left overly full! I should warn tou though, I do not have the worlds biggest appetite,  so if you think of yourself as being a big eater, consider ordering an app on top of your meal.In terms of taste, I really didn't have anything to complain about! The pork was cooked perfectly: nice and tender, not dried out AT ALL! The gnocchi were a little al dente, but I don't mind my pasta being on the harder side. The pasta could've used a liiitttllee more sauce, but no biggy.The flourless cake went above my expectations!  It came with cashews, a banana and chocolate mousse, and they even wrote ""happy birthday "" in chocolate sauce on the plate they served it to me on!  It was enough for us to share after the meals we just consumed!Through getting the dessert for free, ended up spending about $60 for both of us before tip. Not too shaby considering we went out with the intention of having a classier/pricier meal. If you're looking for a place to go out to celebrate a bit more of a special occasion,  I would recommend giving Red's a shot. The ambiance of the place is quite nice (makes you feel like a fancy person for dining there haha), and their menu offers quite a variety of choices,  so you can't really go wrong! :)",4.0,2015-09-04,Yelp

"Walked in when looking for a drink special on a VERY cold Wednesday night. The bartender was so friendly and took pity on a Florida girl experiencing -2 temperatures. I didn't get anything to eat, but loved the $5 (Canadian money) beer. The real treat here is the ""make your own gin and tonic"". OMG. I chose my gin, a nice light tonic and was able to put my own accoutrements in (juniper berries, orange peels, etc). TOTALLY worth the $11.

I just love this place. When I'm in Toronto a visit is a must. Naturally the music is too loud to have a good conversation - but the place is just 'full of life'. I like the barkeeper brining out the ordered beer personally - and also the Somalier if you order wine. The food is really good - I like the shareables very much.

"Five stars for this place might be a bit excessive,  but here are my excuses....I came during Summerlicious at lunch with a large group (please let all those words sink in for a moment) and....1. Not only did the food not seem like a scant, bland version of some better menu, it was delicious and generous. The quinoa salad was superb, but better than that was the fried chicken, which unlike all fried chicken in Toronto, was not too salty, greasy, and overdone. Everyone at my table thoroughly enjoyed their lunch, which is damn hard to do with a big group.2. The service was excellent. Sure, a big restaurant that has large tables should know how to serve groups, maybe. Here, they actually do. The climactic moment of all group service- bringing and splitting the bill- went off without a hitch. The servers acted as if it were perfectly normal and easy to split a cheque. Imagine that!Hats off to Reds for a great lunch.",5.0,2015-07-27,Yelp
"Passed by this place many times.  Decided tonight was the night.  The place is very nicely set up - open concept very large TV screens and great decor.   Music was good also, not too loud just enough to not hear the people next to you.  Good beer selection (ok that's important to me!).

"I went to this restaurant for the Summerlicious 3 course $23 Lunch special with some friends. This was a recently built restaurant so everything looked new and gorgeous with a lot of industrial themed decorations which is a current trend. We made a reservation but it wasn't necessary as there was plenty of seats when we got there in the afternoon.Since there were three of us, we ordered and shared everything from the Summerlicious Menu:Appetizer: Quinoa, Summer Mixed Berry Salad, Shrimp Gazpacho SaladEntree: Roast California Striploin, Pan Seared Trout, Middle Eastern Fried ChickenDessert: Strawberry and Gin Parfait, Chili Chocolate Pot de Crème, Peach CrumbleFor the Appetizer, the berry salad was the winner. The whole salad had a berry scent with slight sweet taste and surprisingly, not too tart. The creamy goat cheese made the dish. It went well with the greens and sprinkle of berries.The Quinoa dish was light and fresh. The quinoa itself was neutral but the salty bitterness of the cheese and sweet apple balanced nicely. The salad also had some pickled onions, providing sour taste and the salad had some spiciness as well.The Shrimp gazpacho was light watery and refereshing for the summer season. The sour sweetness of the vinaigrette sauce in the cup provided a spash of flavour.For entree, the trout and sirloin were both good.The trout was crispy and well seasoned. The skin especially was deliciously crunchy and slightly saltier. It was served how on a bed of lentils. There was a slight sourness from the vinigarett on the beets and matched the creaminess of the avacado. The lentils were not that good however. it was quite chewy having its own separate flavour that didn't match the rest of the dish.The sirloin was juicy, soft, creamy and was light red in the center. It was served hot on a bed of potatoes with sauce. It was exactly what I expect when I think of a steak meal. It is like a hardy english meal. The squash squash matches the creaminess of the meat but lighter and made me think of gravy. This was better than the trout. Visually, the chicken dish was disappointing. It looked like there was more salad than meat. The chicken breast strips were spicy, slightly juicy but not too salty. You can tell that it is not a typical piece of fried chicken. oil spice was drizzled on to the chicken and the salad. The salad that came with this was too sour for my tastes, especially the beets. The chick pea croutons gave a nice crunch to the salad.    For the dessert, the parfait stood out the most. All the dessert had a similar mason jar presentation but not all of them were done well. About the parfait, you could taste the rose water in the whole dessert. The lady finger by itself was sweet but dipped in the parfait made it even sweeter yet, it was not too much for me. The taste reminded me of strawberry shortcake.The chocolate pot was not what I had expected. This pudding had chili flakes that were hard to notice although there, and the whole dish was pretty salty and full of bitter coffee taste. The peach crumble did not have much crumble at all and was pretty soggy. The ice cream was half melted when it arrived because it took so long to get to us. The service was good. The hostess let us choose a seat we preferred and the server gave us sharing plates when we noted that we wanted to try everything on the menu (that doesn't happen often). All the servings came at the same time. The server was available and came to chat about the dishes occasionally. The dessert however took a very long time to get to the table. When looking to get the bill, our server was busy with another customer also doing the same and took a while to get to us.",3.0,2016-03-05,Yelp
"Interesting menu. It's a little bit of everything in an almost exotic far away land kind of way. Indian inspired, Thai inspired, seafood inspired dishes. I'll be honest it's not my foodie palette first choice but I'm happy I tried them out anyway. I really enjoyed my experience there overall. I interacted with 5 staff throughout my lunch and they were all very lovely to speak and engage with; from the hostess, to server, to serving staff to the manager. I had the seafood chowder which was delicious, the smoky bacon added a nice touch to the seafood. I had their Cheeseburger which I added the smoked bacon, combined with their horseradish secret sauce it was an unbelievably amazingly juicy delicious burger. I couldn't finish my salad that came with it. Plus a soda. $29 + $4 for tip. I consider their prices slightly above average but considering the quality of food and quantity and overall experience it was worth it. The atmosphere is elegant. The exposed brick, leather back chairs and wooden chairs combined with the industrial lighting and drapes was perfectly balanced. The music was not too loud. Bathrooms are upstairs.So I was checking out all three restaurants; Red's, Scaddabush and Duke's (all owned by the same company) to decide on my vote for a Christmas lunch with my colleagues. I had a not so good experience at Scaddabush (see that review) the hostess at Red's asked me to come back to let her know my decision after trying all three. I want to include my experience to let you know how awesome Red's is...I popped in to let her know and she was disappointed by my story (about Scaddabush) and let me know the general manager was there. I spoke with the general manager and relayed my story. She quickly apologized and offered me lunch since I didn't get one. I kindly thanked her for that but stated I had to get back to the office as the service next door was also slow. I asked that she relay to all the staff at Red's that what they are doing there is great and to keep up the great work. They will be my number 1 choice.

"The problem with bar/restaurant hybrids downtown has always been the scale of extremes. Its either comfortably on one side of the scale, in the cheap student / sports bar / terrible food / so loud you have to yell or its on the completely opposite side, the uncomfortably full of Bay St. suits / expensive amazing food / good luck getting service if you're there for dinner side. Reds Midtown Tavern sits perfectly in the middle of this scale and it glorious.Made a reservation for an annual get together of old friends, never having gone before I was depending completely on a friends' recommendation and he was not wrong (he never is), the place is fantastic. We sat in the area to the left of the bar (which I think is the lounge but I may be wrong) with the nice comfortable leather high-back chairs, had food and drinks for about five hours and it is now my new favourite place. The location is good, close to subway and the downtown in general. The staff is super friendly and more than happy to recommend dishes which where right on point. Reds Midtown is comfortable without being a pub yet has food as good if not better than some of the higher end Bay St. restaurants, its like a Unicorn and you should definitely take a ride. The only downside is that I could see how it could be noisy on busier days. We went on a Tuesday night and it was pretty noisy at 7:00pm but started to get quieter around 9pm. Other than that the ambiance is very warm and welcoming, it is a neutral meeting point for 9-5'ers, suits and creatives alike.",5.0,2015-12-09,Yelp

It also needed some lemon but there were none provided on the plate.Dessert: Chili Chocolate Pot de Creme - the chili was overpowering... everybody made a face on the first bite.  I didn't end up finishing mine as it was just a bit too strong.Ambiance - nice, dark and has a rustic feel.  They also have a patio area if you don't mind sitting on the sidewalk....

"I'm a fan of the Reds in the financial district and last night, I found myself at the midtown location for the first time.  The service was lovely and attentive, no complaints there.  I ended up ordering off of the summerlicious menu b/c some of the offerings looked delicious.I started with the quinoa salad with apples and aged cheddar.  This was fantastic - completely exceeded my expectations.  For my main, I ordered a fried chicken dish with beet/cauliflower  salad and this spicy chili sauce.  It was SO spicy, which I enjoyed, but I can imagine it being way too hot for the average person.  The chicken was incredible.  The other 7 people at my table opted for the steak or fish, and many were jealous of my pick.  For dessert, the chocolate pot de creme with chili was a bit of a let down.  Could not taste the chili at all.I think Reds is simply a good option, anytime.  It's a great place to go if you want food that is a bit more inventive without being too out there.  I love the decor - the glass, leather and wood.  It's really pretty, but not dainty.",4.0,2015-07-09,Yelp
"Giant goblets of gin and tonic.  $8 on Friday nights.  This was a recipe for success!  I organized a social event for a large group and we sat at a table in the shape of a U.  I hate going out for dinner and sitting in a long line.  This unique set-up allowed for conversation across and between everyone.  I liked it.  The servers, Fab and Jonathan, were excellent.  Extremely attentive, friendly, and entertaining!  I couldn't have asked for more.  Thanks guys!The food was quite good and everyone was able to find something they liked.  We tried a couple of starters too, the potato flatbread and the lobster guacamole with chips.  Both were yummy.  I had the seared ahi tuna Niçoise salad.  I thought the dressing to be a bit heavy but the fish was perfection.  I wished the portion were a tad larger though.Upon making the reservation, I did ask for separate bills.  This wasn't a problem.  They even split the appetizer amongst ten people!  Impressive.  With a large party, the auto-grat was 18%. Very fair given the lovely and lively evening we had!  Thank you for making my night!",4.0,2015-04-26,Yelp

"Argh. This is sort of a bummer because I previously came to Reds for an event, really liked it (and its affiliates next door), and had put it on the office party shortlist. In the meantime, I brought someone for birthday drinks/snacks...which as you know inexplicably and inevitably causes whatever place you choose to let you down in an epic manner, causing embarrassment to all.My friend's medium-rare steak ($20) came completely overcooked (literally 100% of the outside was charred). We patiently waited for probably 20 minutes for someone to come our direction. Several servers floated by but never made eye contact or approached us before leaving again. Then they just disappeared. I finally managed to get our server's attention as she was about to walk away again. The replacement was done properly but it mystifies me why they served the burnt one in the first place.Oysters ($18) were tasty of course, but it beats me how 6 (3 of them tiny) constitute a ""shareable"".Over 2 hours, no one refilled our water. We waited for a long while (notice a pattern?) with empty glasses, then I eventually walked to the bar, grabbed a pitcher, and did it myself. Allllll night. There was no one to flag down. Ever.I would have ordered some drinks (I'd asked for water to start while we were perusing the menu), but...there was no one to flag down.The DJ was fine and this is not supposed to be a quiet venue, but the music was deafening, which made it difficult for my friend and I to converse while trying to pass the time between filling our own water glasses.It was pretty dead after the happy hour crowd left, yet service was nonexistent. By the time someone checked in with us after 9, it was time to leave, so we just got the bill.I owe my friend a make-up birthday outing. Any recommendations?",1.0,2015-04-17,Yelp

This time around the food was decent enough - tandoori chicken salad - it is overpriced, but I guess that's downtown. Service was mediocre and not very flexible.

On top of that, I didn't particularly enjoy my mojito. I found it a little too citrusy and the server apologized, offered to get me something and removed the drink from my bill!

"We came here for Winterlicious lunch and it was a huge let down, as you would expect from a chain resto. First of all, we were automatically seated in the bar area, not even giving the option of eating in the dining area. We had reservations and it was dead. The service was very good. The water was never empty and we had several servers attend to us. The food was very basic and bland. I had beet salad, spicy shrimp & rice, and rocky road dessert. Beet salad was good and interesting, but the shrimp was something you could make at home, and the rocky road dessert was not good at all. The Good:1. Service. As I mentioned, I have no complaints about service and how fast our food came out of the kitchen.2. Decor. Quite nice decor for a chain resto, I enjoyed all the Edison bulbs.The Bad:1. Food.

"First impressions were not that great. I happened to arrive with a group and the main hostess completely ignored me while taking the groups coats. Not sure what made me look like an outcast (perhaps it was the plant I was carrying from work as a goodbye gift) but still - at least have the courtesy to say ""I will be right with you"" or something... Then I had to wait awkwardly as the hostess took that group to their table and to wait for another hostess to take me to mine. Of course, it would have to be right underneath the stereo blasting loud music. Our waiter informed our table that it would be ""louder than normal"" as a group of lawyers bought out half the restaurant. In other words, SOL for us.Our waiter recommended a couple of dishes to try, but OUTSTANDING were the wings. He mentioned that it was one of the best wings he had ever tasted, and our table agreed. I would come back here just for that. Two of my friends had the Lamb and, while it was great, it was nothing outstanding. Another friend had the Salmon, which was, salmon.Total bill including tip, a bottle of wine and a glass of another wine came out to be just shy of $300. I wouldn't come here again for dinner as I don't think the price is worth the food. However, I can say a couple of things though:1. It's a great place for groups and corporate events. Right by the entrance, there was a nice little private nook that could seat up 10 people I think. So, if you're looking to book for a private, smallish-group party, ask for that space.2. I wouldn't come here for a dinner, but a great drinks place and wings (THOSE WINGS WERE FABULOUS!) There is a LARGE bar area in the centre of the roomOur waiter was great. I read a Toronto Life article once about all the ""idiotic questions"" NOT to ask a waiter including what is the best item on the menu and what do you recommend, but one of my friends asked these same questions to him and he answered it obligingly without an eye roll.

"The PositivesThis restaurant should have just started off as a bar/lounge. Their appetizers are top notch and when I mean good, I mean excellent. We ordered the chicken wings which were actually a bit spicy but they were amazing. I love the sauce because it's heavy and creamy, I was licking my fingers going yum yum. The other dish we ordered was the maine lobster guacamole which had the best testing crisp tortillas. These tortillas were big and I swear my friends took all the guacamole before I could grab more.The NegativesThe only problem with the apps? They were skyrocket expensive lol. And now we move onto the entrees. The grilled cheese sandwich priced at roughly $13-14 was warm and tasty but the portions = too small. I've had a grilled cheese sandwich at Joey's and they were better. But you know what it wasn't bad...and then the umami burger came and holy crap, what were we eating? The portion for this burger was adequate but everything tasted so dry. The burger had a very bland taste and I gave up eating that thing half way through. I think I might be mistaken here but this restaurant does not offer beer in pitchers or half pints, perhaps because this is fine dining? I am not too familiar with that and our group felt disappointed - only half of us ordered pints afterwards.The verdictThe restaurant looks extremely nice but is a hassle to locate - even for those who are good at google. I found it weird that the washrooms were located on the second floor - very atypical for a fine dining restaurant like this - not deducting points, just an observation. I found the servers extremely helpful and really think they deserve an ""A"". The biggest disappointment is in the food: for the price we were paying this restaurant doesn't justify a second visit. This restaurant can do so much better and I really wish it can.",3.0,2014-10-13,Yelp
"I used to quite like Reds despite it's corporate connections but I've noticed from my most recent visit that their new menu appears to have scaled back portions yet maintaining the same prices as before. The ahi tuna beet salad that I've ordered at the Adelaide location twice before was an amazing dish - plentiful helpings of beets (both raw and roasted), crisp greens and a nice portion of seared sesame crusted tuna with this supreb dressing. Now it's a sad little salad they've tried to pass off as an entree when it was barely filling enough for a main meal... Thank goodness I was going to another party after that cause I was starving!! The salad used have so many beets (which were deliciously prepared) but this time I could barely find 4 pieces on my plate... wtf beets aren't even that expensive?!?! I'm pretty sure the departure of their previous corporate chef Michael Hunter has something to do with the now mediocre, clearly scaled back portions to maximize profit food.

Not amazing, HAVE to order it next time I go, but solid. The crispy potato flatbread, on the other hand, was delicious and substantially more decadent than I expected - the dough kinda reminded me of a savory funnel cake. Would definitely order again!Ordered two $5 beer specials (I think it was Creemore on a Wednesday - my memory is terrible), 2 glasses of wine, and two appys.

"Here is what you get with this restaurant, glitzy decor, a nice ambiance and nice hostesses. I'd say it's a place you come to have a drink, share some food to hold you over until dinner and then go somewhere else for dinner.For a downtown place, the standard for food is set so high now that I expect more. I came with a big group for dinner. We ordered several dishes but really I think the only thing that stood out was the Prince Edward Island mussels. It was a huge portion of mussels in a great white wine broth. I do like the bowl it came in with a rack to push the mussels to one side so I can get to the broth at the bottom when I start. Other than that, nothing else seemed that great here.The service wasn't that great. He was helpful at beginning but then seemed to disappear at times. Once when an item of food came, another server brought it, then hesitated, took it away saying ""sorry, this is not for you. is it?"" awkward. And the appetizers came like five minutes apart. awkward.I did like the light fixtures, so at least the millions of dollars spent on decor was well spent. I'd say this is the type of place you might want to head to for drinks and some snacks after work. Perhaps if work is paying. They got some nice shareable foods and lots of drinks.

We went after work around 5:30pm on a Monday evening. The place was teeming with people and since it was still daylight, we asked to be seated outside. Shortly after being seated we were handed our menus & wine list, and some water soon after. The salads come in two sizes and so do some of the appetizers. I ended up ordering a Kale salad while my friend went with the roasted chicken. We got our food perhaps about 20 - 25 mins after placing the order so that was great. My salad was healthy, fresh and had enough quinoa for me to have some intermittent flavour between the fibrous leaves. My friend enjoyed his chicken but complained about the lack of a proper side. As he put it ""A significantly better version of chicken than Swiss Chalet"". Not that we have anything against SC. Overall, this place is decent but I wouldn't go out of my way for the food.

We were seated close to the entrance, but wasn't a big deal for us. Out waiter was great! Really OCD so kept everything in check for us and was checking in at the right times to make sure we were ok with drinks and our food. We started with the flatbread and calamari. Both were excellent and I would highly recommend. The flat bread had a little bit of a sweet, tangy twist which was a pleasant surprise. At the table, there was crispy chicken, chicken carbonara and I personally had the salmon which was pretty good. Portions were also well sized if you feel like doing a 3-course meal. None of the regular menu dessert items appealed to us, so we asked if we could order some of the winterlicious desserts. Bread pudding was great and had a nice toasted marshmallow topping.

The bartender did make a good old fashioned with a bit too large of a block of ice. The bar was loud, and by that, when the server can't hear your order, I mean loud. The menu has some great ethnic blends with traditional bar burger and steak options. I ventured for the curry crisp cauliflower and the lettuce wraps and also had a friend try the butter chicken entree. While the concept was good the flavors fell shy. The cauliflower was a little undercooked and not enough sauce to blend the flavors causing the curry spice to be overpowering. The lettuce wraps lacked all flavor and just weren't good.

"It was my first time dining at Reds on Friday night -- casual upscale dining.The location is great and the decor is very interesting. Take a look at the ceiling and you'll see some of their light fixtures made of wine glasses and beer bottles. The servers were friendly, but as it became busier throughout the night, their presence was a bit lacking. I started with a Pear Bellini and it tasted all right, but I thought it was overpriced (as with many other items on the menu).With appetizers to start, we tried the Calamari, Butcher Board, Lobster Guacamole, and best of all, the Crispy Potato Flatbread. The Crispy Potato Flatbread is a must-try. All the ingredients blend together so nicely, and the extra crispiness to the flatbread is like the cherry on top. I have to mention the tortillas that came with the Lobster Guacamole were greasy, but they were really nice and crispy, like they were straight-out-of-the-oven fresh.For my main, I ordered the Chicken Carbonara. The egg was perfectly poached, and the pasta was perfectly al dente. This cream-less approach made this dish look like a low-fat carbonara (as one of my coworkers called it) and it tasted like so, except all the rigatoni at the bottom of my plate were completely soaked in oil.

"Started with the calamari fritti and was pleasantly surprised with the battered and fried lemon slices. The slices explode with flavour and go well the calamari. The pork tenderloin was flavourful and portion size was perfect. The gnocchi accompanying the tenderloin almost stole the show. The gnocchi was pleasantly spicy and the pan fry gave them a nice texture. The bacon cheeseburger is a little pricey but I would order it again in a heartbeat. The bun is fresh baked and the burger almost melts in your mouth. The menu advertised a knife and fork Caesar salad however I received a standard boring Caesar. The salad was much too small and lacked flavour. Cocktails! Margarita was terrific, I would have ordered another one however I wanted to try the maple bacon bourbon Manhattan. The Maple did not disappoint however I would have liked a bigger piece of bacon on the stir stick. The Caesar (cocktail) was delicious and the olive and kielbasa were a great accompaniment. Service was only ok. We came early in the evening and the place was almost empty. It took a long time to get drinks and longer for refills. Empty plates and glasses were not cleared as quick as I would have liked. Our server explained that he didn't like the look of the cheeseburger so the kitchen did it again. Appreciated that bc the burger was excellent. Overall it was great experience, decor was nice and I enjoyed the comfy chairs.",4.0,2016-06-15,Yelp
"Went for lunch.Service: excellent. Everyone from coatcheck  girl to server had amazing smile. Super friendly staff. Decor: beautiful. I have a soft spot for exposed brick walls and this place features exposed brick wall throughout, very inviting. There are communal tables for groups in one section of the restaurant. Plus: TV by the bar for hockey fans. If you are bored for some reason, use the note pad and pencils on your table to entertain yourself. Food: shared chicken carbonara and smoked turkey/peameal sandwich with fries. Chicken carbonara came with a poached egg so had to try it.  It was creamy , salty and tasty. The sandwich was good but nothing out of ordinary. The blanco roll was soft and they don't skimp on the meat. Fries were delicious with the right amount of salt. A bit disappointing that they don't have sweet potato fries. Oh, they have the same menu for lunch and dinner so portion was big for lunch. In summary, absolutely loved dining here.

"2.5 stars rounded up to 3 thanks to a decent craft beer menu. My overall experience was mixed - I doubt I will return.Service was mixed. It took about 15 minutes before someone took our 1st drink order. Our server was polite and friendly but hard to find throughout the night. At one point I asked a different server for a beer and he said he can't help, he's not my waiter. WTF?... we were a group of 15 with a bill +$1,000 and another server can't help out?Later in the evening the hostess helped out a little. The beer selection was much better than I expected for a wine bar. About 10 craft beers on tap from Ontario. Served in 16 oz glass instead of a traditional pint size. Diversified wine menu but I'm no expert in this regard.For dinner I had the turkey sandwich and fries. The sandwich was ok but the Turkey meat was cold cut style and a little salty. The fries were excellent. I also tried the oysters, calamari and sliders - the sliders were the clear winner. Great atmosphere with high bar top tables - perfect for larger groups of people. Music was 90's hip hop on a Friday night - not my thing. Bathrooms downstairs were always occupied so you had to run upstairs instead, a little annoying. Reds just didn't wow me on my visit. Every positive experience was immediately followed by a negative one... 50/50 doesn't cut it.BK",3.0,2014-10-19,Yelp

"For those who haven't been to Red's it would be comparable to Milestones, Jack Astors, etc. The ""midtown"" location is situated at Yonge/Gerrard in a newly built condo building.The restaurant itself is pretty nice. Large space, open with decent amount of seating. The waitstaff are friendly and eager to please their customers however the waitress we had wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu items. The restaurant has a nice craft beer, drink and wine selection to choose from.The food was disappointing. Selection was not great; the menu is a one-sided large sheet. Our table shared the potato flatbread and calamari  which was very greasy. I also had the chicken carbonara which was boring. My friends ordered the lamb shank which they enjoyed. For dessert we shared the carrot cake- it too seemed oily.I wouldn't go back to Red's unless they change up the menu.

We tried the fried calamari, the charcuterie, and the mussels. Calamari was delectable, nice and and crisp. The batter was one with the squid, which is a big deal for me. The mussels were excellent. Served with grilled bread and not on the cheapy side. A healthy serving that more or less made or experience. The charcuterie was less then impressive, mostly prosciutto and the sides were whatever. Definitely would not order again. The bartender knew how to make a martini, which is nice. He wasn't too impressed with the promo coupon for the food though.

Many beers were out of stock (never seen such a thing).And then this happened ..Sadly, the server needed to make 3 trips to correct our 2 bills for a table of 4 and in the end we settled to work it out between us (still wrong).

"We went on a Friday evening, without a reservation. We were seated promptly, but our hostess tried to put us at a table right by the kitchen. We asked to move and she obliged. Be forewarned - despite its Keg-like decor (lots of wood and glass), this place is pretty loud. The music is pumping non stop, making conversation difficult. It's definitely geared to a younger crowd. The service was quite slow. We had to wait a bit just to get menus, and then another considerable wait for our drinks. We both ordered entrees (no apps), as well as a bottle of wine. As we waited for our meal, we got hungry, so we decided to order an appetizer. Then, suddenly, our entrees appeared. I'd assumed our waitress would have put a hold on our entrees after we ordered the appetizer, but no.  We then asked our waitress to cancel our appetizer, since our entrees had arrived. She looked at me like I was crazy, and clearly wasn't happy about doing that, but she obliged. When she opened our wine bottle, it looked like the first time she was doing it. My wife's pickerel was not good at all...not cooked properly and lukewarm. My seafood pasta was okay, but nothing great. We didn't bother staying for dessert. I'll not be returning, and would not recommend this place. Also, make note: this place is pricey, too pricey for what you get in my opinion.

"So, last night I was invited out to a concert by my girlfriend at the last minute when a friend bailed. She had paid for the tickets so I thought I would take her out for an early dinner in the area before the show.Seeing as Reds Midtown is in the area and that I like the original I figured we could give their new ""midtown"" location a try. This was probably a mistake.I've been to the original Reds on a few occasions and have always found it to be a good afterwork location in the financial district. However, their new location has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. This bad taste is a lot like a big warm glass of pure butter (more on this in a bit).We arrive at dinner just before 7 and were greeted by a friendly hostess who gladly took us to our table. The restaurant was half full but we were ""lucky"" enough to be seated at a half lit table right by the entrance of the kitchen. This table is great for people who really want to see the inner workings of the restaurant world because after last night I now have a full understanding as to how waiters punch in orders and the bickering between staff that goes on at the entrance to a kitchen. (Incase you didn't realize I'm being sarcastic and I found this table to be a personal attack on me as a human being)After strategically picking seats so that we were both in lit portions of the table we decided to peruse the menu. The first thing that became clear was that this is a far smaller menu than the original Reds with more of a focus on the casual items from Reds. After an elongated wait I ordered The Stockton St Club, my girlfriend got The Southern Thai Slaw and to start we split the Yukatan Ceviche.(NOTE ABOUT THE MENU: There is no ""Stockton St"" in Toronto. Though after a lengthy investigation there appears to be a Stockton Rd at The Allen and 401. Sooooooo, typo perhaps?)Let's start at the beginning, shall we? The ceviche left a lot to be desired. Delivered in an old fashioned glass it was pretty much impossible to get to the ceviche with the supplied tortillas once we were halfway done. Beyond this glaring failure in dish engineering the ceviche just stunk. The fish lacked firmness to the point where it was essentially mush. The dish was mixed poorly with not nearly enough acid at the top and far too much at the bottom. As if that wasn't enough the kicker was the fact that they didn't even give us plates. But hey! When you're at a table like this what more do you want?!Onto the mains, the club sandwich had some sort of green paste mixture that I'm pretty sure in the freshest guacamole that Subway has to offer. This sandwich is also great if you've ever wanted to taste what a piece of rye bread dipped into a vat of butter tastes like. The sandwich was falling apart before I even took my first bite as the soggy butter bread just could not take it anymore! Needless to say I don't know what club I'm in after having this disaster but I want out.I don't know if there's anything I can say about The Sourthern Thai Slaw Salad that my girlfriend didn't say when I asked her how it was. She frowned and said, ""This sucks"".There you have it! Don't go to Reds Midtown because it is just the worst.Honestly, I'd dump me too if I took me to a place like this.",2.0,2014-05-14,Yelp

We don't get that many options unless we are willing to walk couple blocks away from the busy intersection.All we are left with is franchise restaurants (not that there is anything wrong with them, my favorite is Joeys) like Joeys, Jack Astors, Milestones, Pickle Barrel and etc.So when I heard Reds Tavern was opening a second location at Gerrald and Yonge, I was more than happy to check it out- especially since I had pretty good dining experience at the one located on Adelaide in Financial District.This location is much more 'hip and young' compared to the other location, filled with younger crowd from Ryerson and Eaton's Centre.Reds Midtown Tavern is led by Executive Chef Matt Robertson, who has created an impressive menu of reimagined classics with a unique selection of social sharing plates.Ordered: Calamari Fritti Di Amalfi 5/5Oven roasted tomato aioli, fresh lime and fried rosemary and lemon for $11.25. I loved this calamari, first of all I was surprised by how big the portion was- it was enough to share between 4 people. It was done perfectly, seasoned just right and crispy outside. Very often I find aioli served at restaurants to be too watery, but the oven roasted tomato aioli that was served with calamari was bursting with flavor. I will def get this dish again when I go back.Ordered: Maine Lobster Guacamole 3/5Guajillo chili dressed lobster, hand mashed avocado, fresh lime juice, serrano pepper and warm, crisp tortillas for $17.95. This was an appetizer that I was very excited about but didn't really live up to my expectation. Crispy chips and guacamole was standard but the lobster on top didn't do much for me. Lobster pieces were big and fresh but it just didn't go together with the guacamole nor did it have much flavor.Ordered: Cheeseburger Sliders 4/5Classic mini burgers served with tangy American cheese, everything sauce and pickle for $14.50. 3 of these were served for us to share and they were surprisingly delicious. Patties were tender and juicy between Ace bakery mini slider buns and would be good even as a main dish.Ordered: North Atlantic Seafood Chowder 2.5/5Traditional New England chowder with cold water white fish, tender surf clams and a hint of smoked bacon, cup for $6 or bowl for $9. I ordered a cup to try and was satisfied with what it was. Creamy and filled with lots of seafood but it's not something I will remember to order again.Ordered: Wild Mushroom Soup 2/5Herb scented roasted chicken broth with woodland mushrooms, truffled enoki salad and crisp parmesan croutons, cup for $6 or bowl for $9. This is not your ordinary creamy mushroom soup! Some people might like this but I didn't really enjoy it.Ordered: Avocado & Lobster CobbEast Coast lobster with crisp pork belly, 63-degree egg, fresh croutons, cherry tomato and a poached shallot dressing for $26.95. This was another dish I was disappointed with. There weren't much lobster on this Lobster Cobb Salad and even minus the lobster, it wasn't a good Cobb salad. I def didn't think this was worth $26.95Ordered: Bake Kale & Quinoa Salad 3/5Tossed with sweet spiced pecans, dried cranberries, caramelized sweet potatoes, smoked Manchego cheese and a citrus vinaigrette for $9.50 (Starter size). This dish was ordered and shared as an appetizer and it was a nice light salad on the side.Ordered: Cioppino 5/5Light tomato and white wine seafood stew with PEI mussels, calamari, shrimp and scallops served with crusty garlic rubbed baguette for $19.25. Another solid dish I was excited to find during this dinner. Tomato stew was nice and hearty, def a winter food that makes you all warm inside. I will def get this again when I go back.Summary: Thank goodness Reds Midtown Tavern opened on Gerrald street where it is much more laid back without that stiff financial crowd. It is a nicer walk from where I live and love the wide wine selection. I've been back couple more times after my first visit and I've always had an awesome time here.

The Elephant and Castle and Pogue Mahones have been the only choices nearby for years, but this pub really takes it up a notch.This is a huge restaurant with a wonderful atmosphere and a couple of partial second floors, meaning most of the space has huge ceilings. Lots of brick and interesting light features.The beer and cocktail list is extensive, as you would expect from a more upscale pub. The prices were actually pretty reasonable though, which I wasn't expecting.The menu was also interesting. I went with the tandoori-spiced chicken salad, and it was very flavourful with a decent portion size.The service was great and well organized. I arrived before my wife and they took her name so that they could direct her to my table. Again, this place is very big.I definitely plan to return to explore the rest of the menu.

"Got a really good first impression by the friendly hostess and ambience of the place but once i sat at the bar everything went downhill from there. Waited over 5 minutes to even get acknowledged by the bartender. No hi how are you or friendly small talk or even a crack of a smile. I ordered the chicken tandoori salad. I was told it was a good choice but it was quite opposite. The chicken was too charred so all i good taste was burnt charred chicken. I was also told the chicken was a 5-6oz portion...negative...it was only about 3oz. They were chinsy on the cashews (only got two in my salad) and crispy cauliflower (only a few little pieces). The bartender never once asked me how my food was. I would have asked for a new chicken and more topping had i been given the opportunity but didn't feel like complaining. After the subpar meal the server handed me the bill. I paid and still tipped her 20% and thanked her. There was no reciprocation whatsoever...she didnt seem in the slightest grateful for a 20% tip that she certainly didn't deserve as there was thank you...no you're welcome...no have a nice evening. Just left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not sure how that bartender even has a job there. The quality of service and a friendly, outgoing personality is what matters most during a dining experience and i know this because i worked in the hospitality and service industry for over 15 years. Pretty straightforward concept. Perhaps she was having an off day but everyone knows that in that industry in particular you gotta leave the excess baggage at the door.

"I went here for summerlicios and ordered the sole crisp salad, the steak and parfait for dessert. The food was cold, under seasoned, the meat was tough, fatty and barely edible.  The food came out so fast you know the food wasn't made to order. It's too bad, summerlicious is supposed to allow you to try your menu and potentially gain new patronage. If I hadn't been here before then I would recommend not to go but maybe skip the prix fixe menu as it's underwhelming.",2.0,2015-07-11,Yelp

I was on Friday August 1st for our date night and we had a great time.  The service was great and very attentive.  The G&T's are good but a little pricey for my liking - although it didn't stop me from ordering two!  The food was delicious: we started with the crispy potato flat bread and ceviche; and the cioppino for my main.  All were very flavorful I would recommend.  My only compliant would be that there isn't a lot to choose from on the menu for dinner.  Definitely a good spot for drinks and apps!,4.0,2014-08-04,Yelp
"This restaurant is in such a beautiful space. I love the light fixtures! We had a reservation for 10, which was acknowledged upon arrival. Our server (who looked like Katy Perry) was informative of both the food and drink menu. Extensive beer selection and standard wine list. There are unique large gin based drinks, reasonably priced ($10-$13). I had the ceviche as a starter and oscar sirloin with fully loaded potato. The ceviche was alright and the portion was small--6-7 chips topped with ceviche for $13 was steep. I had hoped there was more toppings, as my potato was bare after 3 bites. The highlight of my meal was undoubtedly the steak; cooked perfectly rare and of quality. The other girls at my table also commented on how great their steaks were, and how we would come back for it. The sticky toffee dessert ($7) was small but really good. Do NOT order the flourless chocolate cake; the texture and taste resembles canned icing with a caramelized banana on top. All in all, a beautiful atmosphere with reasonably priced drinks, good food (depending on what you order), and nice service.",4.0,2015-02-22,Yelp
"I dine weekly at any of the restaurants by Sir Crop, the management company that owns Red's. I spend over $800 a month at their restaurants and have always received good to excellent service. So I was very much looking forward to a Friday night out with a bottle of wine at Red's. What an absolute disappointment.We ordered our favorite, a Kermit Lynch Cote-du Rhone that was selling at an extremely good price ($42) as we typically pay over $60 for this bottle in Yorkville. It was disappointing to learn, 10 minutes later, that this wine was out of stock. Our waiter then mentioned they were out of 3 additional bottles, and after he pointed out which ones, we proceeded to order a different bottle of wine from Italy as well as some food. Imagine our surprise when he came back another 10 minutes later to tell us, that this bottle too, was out of stock. After asking him to check his cellar and come back, something he refused to do and insisted that they had all the other wines, we finally ordered a 3rd bottle. Few minutes pass and he comes back with a bottle. We take a look at it, and realize he has brought the wrong wine from a totally different Region (we ordered a European wine and he bought us one from Argentina). We point this out to him, and please note, it has now been 30 minutes and we have no food or wine. He goes to the bar and then comes back saying that this 3rd bottle is also sold out so they just substituted it to a different bottle! Rightfully so, I got angry and asked to speak to their manager. Their manager, whom I will not name, came over to us with a smirk on his face. I assume he thought we were students looking for a hand out. He leaned over our table, put his chin on his hands, and asked us what he could do for us. I re-iterated the story and the entire time he was just smirking away and not really caring about what we said. Not once did he apologize, he just made excuses and told us to give him 7-10 minutes to see what he had in his cellar. Within a munute he comes back with our original Cote-Du-Rhone! At this point, we wer done and asked to leave. Rather then apologizing, he just said 'Are you sure you want to leave? I will comp this bottle which should make you happy'. That was just adding insult to the injury here and we walked out.I received a survey asking me to rate my experience and I gave it a 0. I e-mailed back and forth with their Regional manager who apologized and made excuses and finally offered me a free dinner with a bottle of wine as well as a personal apology on the day we go there. I finally agreed to this as I thought he was trying. So when I gave him a date, imagine how I felt when he said he will e-mail a $50 gift card to the restaurant of my choiceThey do not value customers. If they did, they would genuinely try to apologize, and if management is saying I will be there personally to greet you and dinner with wine is on me, why are you sending in a gift card and then capping dinner? The restaurant we chose - minimum we have ever spent there is $160!! We declined his offer, as again, we wanted to bring attention to the service issues and get a proper apology, not a freebie. I will be thinking twice before I ever go into any of Sir Corp restaurants again will make sure I tell everyone of my experience.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserR…",1.0,2015-06-22,Yelp
"After the pretty ballerina had to bail out last minute due to not feeling well, it was a solo lupper for yours truly. This plae was chosen because OpenTable indicated they were taking ares at 15:30 or 3:30 pm! I was a fan of the old Reds Bistro, and when they announced the revamping and rebranding of the restaurant on Adelaide, as well as the opening of this location, I was fearing a Moxification or worse, a JackAstorization. Even though the decor is more rustic and rich in hardwood, living up to the tavern ""moniker"", and the establishment has shied away from all the haute cuisine trappings (tuxes on waiters, sommelier at your table, etc) the kitchen did not lose its lustre. Initially disappointed that the oysters of the day had run out, I ordered the Mediterranean braised lamb shank($22.95), described on the menu as ""8-hour slow-cooked lamb with creamy polenta, green beans, orange gremolata and black olive relish"" it is true to the description, falloff the bone and delicious. Polenta made this way is a revelation for me, and with this type of preparation is more enjoyable than rice or potato. Today, no green beans but al dente snap peas.To drink I had 9oz (18.00) and then 6 oz (12.00) of a superb red Bordeaux, Chateau Christoly, a great pairing with the shank as well as with what followed it.The dessert menu is uninspiring(carrot cake? flourless chocolate cake? mint and chocolate parfait? meh...)and would benefit from more creativity. Instead, I opted for the excellent cheeseplate (6.00 per oz so 18.00 in this case):  Picobello, a sheep milk cheese from  Spain,  Chevrechon, a goat from Quebec, and Celtic blue from Ontario. With garnishes of in-house candied walnuts, edible flowers, honey and raisin compote, this platter marries salty and sweet superbly.So if you are looking for a decent meal near the Eaton centre and are neither hankering for Salad KIng nor for The Senator, but for something more refined, this is an excellent choice an affordable.The only minus to me though is the seating. While comfortable, there are mostlyhigh chairs/stools available for a more tavernish/barish atmosphere. While this all fun and esthetically pleasing, I know many a patron who would prefer a normal chair.Service was friendly and professional. Shasa and Jake were awesome.So,yes,recommended.",4.0,2014-02-17,Yelp
"I went to Reds for dinner once. The restaurant is huge and I saw a large group of office people celebrating a birthday and there were also some families having dinner. It has a nice vibe and the location is excellent.  The food was alright but the food took long to get to the table. I had the chicken carbonara and it was pretty big but not that delicious, so I decided to try a dessert. I had the mint and chocolate mousse, but I couldn't finish it because it was too thick and filling. I went there with 2 friends and none of them finished their desserts either. Don't get me wrong, the taste was good but the consistency was just too thick. It would have been a better idea to share the dessert. I think it looks like a good spot for drinks after work and for that, I'd go back. Also because they have a nice long patio.",3.0,2014-08-12,Yelp

"Although the wait staff was outstanding, in particular Hannah, the steaks that were ordered caused quite a problem.Since they were substantially under cooked, we had to send them back not once but twice to the kitchen before everything was rectified.Sadly, after sending the steaks back a second time we actually had a manager of sorts pay us a visit at the table wherein she told us that the steaks were cooked as ordered. ( One was medium-well and the other well done.)  Both were oozing blood on the plates and by no means were cooked as requested.  Although she was very indignant and indicated that the steaks were cooked to their thermometers reading, she finally did concede that the well done one was in fact  under cooked.Needless to say, the rest of our party had completed their food whilst we were still waiting for ours.  Once received however, I can honestly say that they were delicious as well as the other goodies on our plate.  We were offered a 15% discount on our bill by the way which we declined.

"My girlfriend and I visited for Winterlicious 2016 for her birthday, after having eaten at Red's before. Previously, our food was excellent, with good portions and tasty dishes and great service. We were very surprised to see how disappointing their Winterlicious menu turned out... My girlfriend got the chicken. It was literally a small chicken breast sliced in half, overcooked, and served on a ""bed of potatoes"" which turned out to be one half of a single small potato. That was it. I got the fish, it was quite literally 5 bites of fish. The salad was very uninspired (just romaine lettuce and a few added ingredients), as was the mushroom soup (also was cold), and for dessert both the apple tart and brownies were so hard we could barely eat them with a fork. It was extremely disappointing to say the least. We were still very hungry after and went elsewhere to get a second meal. Surprising, as the food from the normal menu was delicious in our previous encounter, we figured they would put some effort into the Winterlicious event, but sadly was not the case. Would absolutely not recommend attending Winterlicious at REDs.",1.0,2016-02-11,OpenTable

We waited for about 20 minutes to get someone's attention and then another 10 before we got our dessert (it was pre-ordered).  We received an apology, and an explanation that they were really busy with Winterlicious orders, and somehow our order  info did not print in the back (? not sure if I believe that...).  But where was our waitress?  She was missing for most of our wait time.  Not really a big deal, except that it's lunch and we had to get back to work - and we were late....The manager provided us with the explanation, and I felt that perhaps they should have done something (like 20% off the bill) to compesentate for our inconvenience. It was the first time I was there and I recommeded the place to my friends....but we took it good-naturedly.

"We have eaten at Reds quite a few times and always been delighted with the food and service, but not this time. They have changed the way the Shareables are served and presented.  We ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps and the condiments were all put in one of the 4 lettuce wraps so you could not really see what they were.  I did not get any fresh julienne vegetables, red mango or toasted peanuts either because they had run out of them or there was too little present to share with 4 people.    The Shrimp and Scallop Ceviche while it was tasty was devoid of the avocado and tomato.  I liked it when this Ceviche was served in a glass so you could see all of the ingredients and take delight in its beautiful preparation and presentation.  I ordered the Mediterranean Braised Lamb Shank and the overuse of one spice, cardamom I think,  in the dish was disappointing.  I have had the Lamb Shank quite a few times before and always loved it but whoever is doing the sauces should taste them to make sure they have not overspiced them.  One of our party order one of their Signature Filet Mignon Steaks and it looked unappetizing.  The Filet Mignon looked like a flatten  hamburger with some cheese on top.

My friend ordered the chicken dish which was described as ""de-boned"" on the menu, but came with a bone in and was accompanied by a small portion of vegetable sides. Her boyfriend ordered a medium filet, which came out rare. The twice baked potato tasted was room temperature, hard and dry as if it was sitting out for a long time.

They offered Stella (blech) at the same discounted price, but nothing of a similar taste. Pretty disappointing. (2) Their hostess team is  inept - after checking in and being seated at the table for 30 minutes, I received a call from them asking where I was for my reservation. I confirmed that I had arrived TWICE, yet I still received a no show email from OpenTable. Overall, still a solid choice in the neighbourhood for a quick bite or drinks after work.

I booked my reservation through open table and specified under special instructions that I wanted a  birthday dessert for Daniel Felsky.  I also reminded the waiter toward the end of the meal.  A different waiter came and took the dessert order and Daniel did not get anything special with his dessert not even a candle.our original waiter came back after the dessert was finished and apologized and said that a Happy Birthday dessert presentation went to the wrong table and we got the plain dessert. This item was deducted from our bill but we would have preferred that something with Happy Birthday was  brought to the table for Daniel to eat or take home.One of the other party ordered coffee and never received it.My husband orders some sort of steak salad but was disappointed with his meal.  He said it was simply a steak on a bed of leaf lettuce with no other vegetable mixed in or any interesting textures.  My meal was tasty -curry chicken special - but I was disappointed with the quantity which seemed to contain about 4 bite size pieces of chicken and a few snow peas.

"We were gifted a SIRCORP gift card and thought we'd try Red's out instead of our usual SIRCORP favourite (Canyon Creek). Once we were seated I noticed they had what is probably the best gin & tonic selection in the city if not Canada. They brought me a perfectly made (and huge) gin and tonic complete with bitters. The night started out perfectly!We ordered the charcuterie board to share, which was dropped off at our table without the customary description of each meat on the board, and without plates or utensils. So we had to sit there staring at the food until we could finally get a waitress to notice us and bring us some plates and cutlery. Unfortunately the charcuterie left much to be desired and could easily have been pre-packaged Piller's products picked up from the supermarket. The bread that came with it was positively stale. It was not crispy, it was stale.For the main my wife ordered the Bacon-Wrapped Filet Mignon and I ordered the Mediterranean Braised Lamb Shank but I replaced the boring polenta side with truffle fries. This was quite simply the BEST entrée I've ever had and completely compensated for the poor service and terrible appetizer. I touched the lamb with my fork and it quite literally fell off the bone into a neat pile on the plate. I always thought that ""fall off the bone"" meat was a myth, but I have to say this was spectacular, tender and perfectly seasoned! The truffle fries were similar perfection and I was a very happy camper.

"Overall the experience was good, I might have even rated it very good if I wasn't comparing it to their Adelaide location which I have frequented over the years and have nothing negative to say about it.  The midtown location is missing the high level of service, the speed and attention to detail that I'm used to.  We were 4 girl friends out for a post-work/pre-Christmas gathering.  The decor and atmosphere of the place was great, but as soon as we sat down we noticed that the lighting was poorly planned over some of the dining tables (half the table was in the dark while the other half was blinded by spotlights), we asked to be seated at a different table (several looked available) on two separate occasions but were told that we'd have the same problem at those tables too and then told that they would dim the lights (which they did not do).  We ended up physically moving our table to a more suitable angle.  When we were seated, we were brought the dinner menus but no drink/wine list - which, for a wine bar is quite the mistake.  We had to ask for the wine list and only got it after we ordered our food.  We decided to not order individual meals, but a bunch of their super tasty appetizers to share.  This might be why we were not asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu, but I think it was inappropriate for them to assume we weren't interested.  We ended up at a coffee shop down the road after for coffee and dessert.The food was fantastic, the wine selection as can be expected was great, and everyone was super nice (just not on the ball).  I believe this location is relatively new so maybe that's why they haven't mastered the art of customer service, but everything else is great and this should not deter anyone from going.

I paid for a $50 bottle of wine and my meal is served with fries. Shape up. That's disgusting. ,4.0,2014-05-11,OpenTable
"Overall our party enjoyed Reds. There were a couple hits (Aegean lamb salad, sirloin salad, cioppino) and a couple misses (greasy club sandwich), but the menu had many more things we would come back to try. Also tried several wines and beers from the well-curated beverage menu, none of which disappointed. The main downfall was the server, who seemed disinterested in our table from the start and didn't do a good job assuring us that an allergy at the table would be looked after. Would still recommend it for the food, drinks and atmosphere. ",4.0,2014-05-10,OpenTable
This was our first time dining at Reds. I had the slaw with chicken and was a little disappointed in the favour and the chicken was odd in size and texture...like it wasn't real.

Nice set up and good initial service. The appetizers were great but the main courses were a mixed bag. The Curry of the day was bland uninteresting and had nothing but meat and rice. No vegetable! The music was fine when we first arrived but by the time we left it was too loud to talk. TURN DOWN THE VOLUME.We paid via SIR corporation gift cards. The staff could not get them to process even though they confirmed they were valid. This wrangle went on so long that our guests offered a credit card to speed up the process. Very embarrassing and unnecessary. This issue should have been taken away from the table.,3.0,2014-05-04,OpenTable
"The food was quite good with interesting choices and reasonably priced. However, service was very average at best. The server did not tell us about the specials (we had to ask if there were any) and, while barely friendly, she seemed very indifferent in her overall attitude.

"Six of us went to Reds Midtown Tavern on a Wed eve. The three ladies in our party participated in the wine tasting event which we found to be a great way to start the evening.  Wines were lovely and the charcuterie board was outstanding.  The duck ham was incredible! For dinner we ordered a variety of items for the table. The oysters that night (Raspberry Point from PEI) were fabulous. Fresh and very flavourful.  We also had the cheeseburger sliders(very good but expensive for 3 sliders and no fries/side), Szechwan lettuce wraps (tasty but spicy!), ceviche (not bad, but I have had better), potato flatbread (very yummy), the double dip (ok), and calamari(terrific).

The chips are also perfect not too hard, the right amount of softness with great flavor.",4.0,2017-02-02,TripAdvisor
"Had tried the Winterlicious lunch and dinner menus at Reds Midtown Tavern. My friends and I agreed that they have the best value deal and menu selection comparing with other participated restaurants'. They have a new special cocktails menu and special unbeatable price for selected wines, beers and G&Ts after 4 pm. We had tried the new cocktails and the special priced drinks, it was so good. No matter how busy they are, the customer’s services is always best in class. The servers and assistant servers pay attention to the customer’s special request on their meals are Implausible. Mostly important, they do not treat you just a customer but a family who always enjoy the homemade meals. I had recommended Reds Midtown Tavern to my family and friends.",5.0,2017-02-02,TripAdvisor
"My friends and I went here for lunch after our massage at Elmwood Spa on Sunday. We tried their Winterlicious Menu...$18 for a 3-course meal...great deal. I had the Butternut squash soup for the appetizer. It was okay. It was in the salty side. Their Shrimp Ravioli pasta was amazing though! I just wish there was more (I had like 5-6 ravioli pieces with shrimp on top) LoL. It was so delicious though. But what really topped it off for us was their Toffee Cake. It was incredible! I want to go back just to taste that Toffee Cake again! It was soooo yummy and moist and caramelly (not even sure if this is a word but it is now. LoL) and just perfection! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! LoLOverall, it was a great place to try. The Winterlicious promo is only on until February 9 so I highly recommend you to try it :)",4.0,2017-01-31,TripAdvisor

Had lunch with a buddy on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant is located right on the corner of Yonge and Gerrard in midtown Toronto. At 12:30 it was not very busy in the lounge area and we were seated quickly.The place is large and well decorated with a lot of natural light. Our server was very efficient and friendly and made a few recommendations. I decided on my go-to burger and fries (I'm so adventurous). The patty was gigantic and clearly hand made.

"I've been meaning to come to Reds for sometime. Well reviewed and recommended in circles around the office. Often used by colleagues for lunch time office celebrations...birthdays, seasonal celebrations etc. I was a bit nervous because I'm more of a slow, intimate, quite kind of a diner. Less of a steakhouse, loud music kind of a guy. Some of that might be because I'm a vegetarian. The setting was intimate, gentle lighting. Music a touch loud for my delicate constitution but hey, 80's music is always a winner. The food was above, way above expected. Garden salad, truffle fries to start and there was the flash back to Tuscany. My partner had the salmon dish, fingerling potatoes with heirloom carrots and snow peas. 11 out of 10. I had the vegetarian, vegetable fricasee. Delicious, perfectly cooked and bursting in flavour if not a little too busy with the aforementioned flavours. 9.5/10Apple pie with cheddar, outstanding. Espresso delicious. Staff professional, friendly and attentive. What else can be said? Shout out to Felix the waitstaff for making the visit memorable.",4.0,2017-01-24,TripAdvisor

A fantastic dish, it was incredibly tasty. for desert, Michael suggested sticky toffee pudding. I very nearly ordered a second portion it was so good ! The only downside to our visit was the volume of the music. It was so loud conversation was difficult. We had to yell for the server to hear us. And not having room in the empty dining room?

Although the room is handsome looking, it is not au courant and has a bit of a dated feel.The food, however, is dependably good and the wait staff anxious to please.On my last visit, we were rushed and needed to eat something that could be prepared quickly. On the advise of the server, we ordered the tuna tostados and edamame. They came out within 5 minutes. Both were delicious and the plating was good.

All the design detail in the world will not rescue the place from horrible food. The menu is too rambling for the skill of the kitchen staff and some of the dishes are just plain silly. Silly - - something they call nachos which is really ketchup on a deep fried wonyon with more ketchup and what used to be a chicken. - portobello mushroom - this is actually a poorly prepared steak with a not very fresh version of a mushed lobster and a flat tired shoe leather of a mushroom. Served with unpalatable mashed potatoes. Just plain bad - fish and chips. Fish - frozen and refrozen too many times and then battered in a ""Chardonnay Batter"" - horrible. Unseasoned. If you are going to spend that much money on the leasehold improvements for the restaurant - try and have something edible.

The food was top notch, my friend changed her mind at the last minute but the order was changed with no problem and brought fresh food. Grade A service",5.0,2016-02-09,TripAdvisor
"Reds Midtown has everything you need for a business lunch - fast, friendly and efficient service and a menu that does the job. The food is a cut above pub fare (but, then again, prices are also a cut above pub prices). Hamburgers, salads and pasta were all pretty good, but not spectacular. Unlike many tavern-style establishments, there is no beverage pressure from the wait staff - if you simply want a glass of water there are no public shaming glances.",4.0,2016-01-19,TripAdvisor
"So I work in the neighbourhood and used to have dinner at the Red's financial district location. I am always happy/satisfied with the meals there but it's not for a cheap lunch/dinner. On that day I sat at the bar, and got their bacon cheese burger and fries. Previously I have had the oysters, sliders, edamame, calamari and they are all what you expect. The service at the bar was excellent, and felt confident that if I had a complaint it would be handled. I have complained previously and they have been good at dealing with it. I will go back, although if you are looking for a better beer list go a little down Gerard same block to Duke's. (same ownership group I think)",4.0,2016-01-14,TripAdvisor
"If you are G&T fan, you need to pay this little place a visit. A whole menu dedicated to the perfect G&T. Tried several and they were all surprisingly unique and delicious. Some pre-made specialities and some options to customize. The food is also quite good. Service was a bit slow and there were not many people in the restaurant at the time. Recommend if you are looking to experience some new G&T options.",4.0,2016-01-01,TripAdvisor
"I visited this establishment for some drinks and have to say the service was awful .Although it's a really nice decor and vibe the servers we had were miserable , uncaring and not helpful at all !!There was a group of about 8 of us who walked in off the street with some ordering food and others just drinks .... The wait time for each ordered drink was anything from 10-20 minutes !! Food was even longer ... Wait time 45 minutes When the bill finally came we were surprised to see an automatic gratuity added to each individual bill .... When we questioned this we were told this was explained to the person on the phone who made the reservation ... We then explained that we had never made any reservations to which the manager then said the server told us this when we first walked in . This was definitely NOT the case and the whole situation left us feeling very uncomfortable that they were questioning our honesty .I've Never experienced such amateurish and poor customer service and will most definitely not be going back here or recommending this bar",1.0,2015-12-22,TripAdvisor

"So I came here on a Friday night and actually had no wait for a table for two, we came around 830-9. For starter we had a calamari, this was a little disappointing. For the price younger a very very small amount of calamari, it's tasty but small portioned wouldn't recommend. For a main I had a steak and truffle fries. Overall steak was tasty and so were the fries but I was not totally blown away. I would personally pick like an Earls or Keg over this I think, just due to the amount of food you get there for your money. This place was a nice change up though, and had a good atmosphere and our server was great. Might go again.",4.0,2015-12-20,TripAdvisor
"The food was not great but it was good, nice busy atmosphere and a great place to talk. I wished they had organic wine but still enjoyed what they had. One thing I would ask: Please tell your staff not to be racist. If it's your opinion, as we chat of other things, that Toronto is becoming ""too diverse,"" and you don't want immigrants here, maybe don't say it out loud. It shocked me, depressed my friend. But the other waitstaff were great. Truthfully? I wouldn't come back because of that guy.",3.0,2015-12-16,TripAdvisor
"Absolutely awful place! I had been living in Toronto for a few months and had read what I thought were good reviews of this place so when friends were over visiting I thought it would be fun to try out. The hostess was the most friendly one and considering we couldn't even catch eye contact with any other members of staff thats saying something! The hostess asked a server to show us to a certain table and instead of saying anything to us eg 'follow me ladies' he just walked off so we decided to follow him. He brought us to a dirty table that had to be wiped down while we just stood around it even though it was a Monday evening with plenty of other free tables. He made a pretty sad attempt at wiping down the table then walked away without so much as a smile. Having worked in the industry for many years everything about this place was just an awful experience from the customers point of view.We were out for the night and willing to spend a good amount here yet after 10 minutes of being absolutely ignored by every single server we put on our coats and left as the hostess just watched us walk out. I almost expected her to check if everything was ok considering she had just ""welcomed"" us in 10 minutes prior but even that is too much to expect here.",1.0,2015-12-15,TripAdvisor

Visited for dinner as I have been here a few times and liked it every time. We went on an Wednesday evening and it was fairly busy. Service was prompt at first but once we got our drinks and placed our food order we were had reseed to get anyone's attention. After waiting over 30 minutes for our food we finally got someone's attention so we could inquire as to status of our order. Our food was finally delivered and we expressed our concern at having to wait so long. The manager looked into the situation and agreed that it should not have taken so long for our food. The manager compted our meals to make up for the inconvenience. Kudos to him and the restaurant!! I would return again!!,4.0,2015-12-11,TripAdvisor
I went to Reds for a business dinner and it was excellent. It was in a great location right between the office and the hotel we were staying at. We all ordered steaks and I in particular ordered the Lobster sirloin and I can't say enough good things. It was cooked to perfection and the mashed potatoes were really good and the asparagus wasn't overcooked. Their wine selection was great too sadly they ran out of the Cab Sav but they didn't hesitate to allow me to try a sample of another wine which was great. The wash rooms were clean and the ambiance was great. Definitely loved the atmosphere. I will definitely have to eat here again next time I'm in the city.,5.0,2015-11-18,TripAdvisor

"this bar and restaurant is well situated in Yonge Street and close to several large hotels. Walking in I felt we stepped back into the 20s exposed brick, wine bottle chandelier, wood everywhere and a large selection of gin drinks. The also were running classic black and white movies on their TV screens (some framed to look like old photos. We were waiting for our group to arrive so had a drink in the bar as they had a large selection of wines and cocktails. We were then seated in the restaurant side. We had only one server for about 10 of us but he did a fine job. The menu has a large selection of foods with both a curry and a fish dish being rotated daily. Monday was Madras Curry with Lamb - well cooked lamb and a curry that had the right amount of heat served with jasmine rice and some yogurt. Service was attentive and friendly. The brick made it loud and I'm sure if it were later in the week some of our group would not have been able to hear their tablemates well. I think we all enjoyed our meals and would go back.",4.0,2015-11-07,TripAdvisor

We ate here twice as it was across the road from the Chelsea Hotel where we stayed. The food was good but we waited 15 mins to be seated. Wait staff could see us standing there but ignored us.

"On first impressions, the place is nice. Decor is awesome and staff are well dressed and professional looking. This ends as soon as you are seated. I've been in the industry for 20 years so I notice things and I know how things work. There is no excuse for poor service. We were staying in the area and decided to stop in here for a quick drink and a snack after a day of shopping. It was late afternoon and in between lunch and dinner rushes. We sat in the bar area and from what I could see there appeared to be more staff that patrons. We ordered drinks and an appetizer to share. Beers are 14oz, not a standard 20oz pint but you pay 20oz prices. Beer temp was off and beer was warm while my Caesar was weak and tasteless. There was a situation in the kitchen which slowed our food down, the manager came over and explained and apologized which was perfectly acceptable, these things happen, I get it. However, while we waited 20+ minutes for a simple appetizer, we were never offered another round of drinks and sat with empty glasses until we were able to flag someone down to request another drink! I'd like to add that there were several staff milling around the bar area in plain view chatting with what I can only assume were off duty staff sitting at the bar. All while we sat with no food and no drinks!!!! Our food was good, fresh and hot but tiny portion given the price. Undersized and overpriced was my general impression. The service might have made up for it if anyone had bothered paying attention to us. Brutal. Don't waste your money here. There are lots of other great places to eat around here, no wonder it was empty on a Saturday afternoon.",1.0,2015-10-26,TripAdvisor

Also, we were seated in a booth in the back in the complete dark with minimal lighting that my dad was using his flashlight on his cellphone. She noticed this however didn't say anything. Eventually we asked about the lighting and 20min later (at the end of our meal) the lifting was fixed.This was my second time here and I raved about the first time however I'm not sure if I would recommend this restaurant again.",3.0,2015-10-24,TripAdvisor

"Having stayed many times at a hotel next door since the restaurant opened, I have been to Reds many, many more times than I can remember. Sometimes twice a day.The staff has always been incredibly friendly and welcoming. Even if there is a big employee turn over, they seem to train them really well and are able to create a comfortable, welcoming experience every time.Having eaten there around 80 times in two years it always amazes me how perfectly consistent the food is.The roasted chicken, perfectly crispy on the outside, unbelievably juicy and flavourful in the inside arrives perfect every time.The steaks are always soft and flavourful, the stockton club sandwich is really, really good, just to name a few.Even if the food is amazing, what got me hooked at first were the drinks. The cocktails are a perfect mixture of classical and very creative. My favourite without doubt is the Maple Bacon infused Manhattan. This is a perfect place for a quick bite, a romantic dinner or a boisterous night with friends. This place alone has elevated the energy of an area that till very recently was a dead zone in Toronto.",5.0,2015-10-17,TripAdvisor

I had the peppercorn steak with skin on fries which was exactly what was needed having spent the day travelling from New York. Despite not having waited for that long for the food I.e. about 15/20 minutes, the manageress said we waited too long for her liking so she offered us free desserts for which we were shocked and gladly accepted. Excellent customer service and Canadian hospitality and they couldn't do more for us. They also serve some great quality beers and ales some of which are only 5 dollars a pint on certain days and go great with the food.

We have passed this place several times while walking up Yonge Street and often wondered about it. We had cause to come here on an weekday afternoon when the neighbouring pub - the Elephant and Castle - was having AC issues.Let's just say that we wished we are would have stayed at the Elephant and Castle with their heating issues.The waiter was some pretty boy who wasn't that much interested in service. The food was just OK but it was seriously overshadowed by the bad service. Twice we had the timer on the incompetent waiter and we're close to walking out if he didn't deliver. We ended up going next door to the un-airconditioned Elephant and Castle after our meal just so we could experience some great service - something that was seriously lacking at this hole. Long story short - avoid this place like the plague.,2.0,2015-08-19,TripAdvisor
"We came here after a night game at the Rogers Centre, so probably arrived around 10:30 or so. There were about 10 of us in the group and we were looking for dinner, so they were able to accommodate us. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food. The ribeye was good, although pretty peppery. If that's your thing, you'll love it. Chicken wings were another hit. Drinks were good and strong. Service was a little slow, but our server was very sweet. Overall, this was a really nice place. We also played a couple of games of shuffleboard, which was fun (on a little mini table, but still). Seemed like we had quite a few drinks and everyone got at least an appetizer and the bill was still under $300, including tip. Not bad at all.",4.0,2015-08-18,TripAdvisor
This review is only for drinks. Great outdoor patio to have drinks with friends. It's situated off Yonge street so it has a nice atmosphere without cars zooming by. The star drink seems to be their specialty menu of creating your own gin and tonic. Please ask for this menu as it was not given to us and we had to ask specifically for it - my friend was here before so she knew about it. It has a variety of gin - maybe over 20! There are also tonics and herbs that you can choose to create a unique drink. The G&T comes in a huge goblet with ice. It's quite nice and I would go back for that.The other gin based drink was called Al Fresco - recommended by the waiter - I found it too sweet - like juice - so I wouldn't recommend that if you're looking for G&Ts.,4.0,2015-08-17,TripAdvisor

My friend asked for a cocktail that came with a nice little surprise in it... a beer cap!. I work in hospitality so i can understand certain things like slow service in a busy night, or even hair the food... but a beer cap in the cocktail?? that only shows that the bar standards are extremely low. The other big thing that made it for a bad expirience was the time it took the server to bring the drink to the table... Not because she was busy, but because she spent good 10-15 mins talking to couple of guys at the bar, completly ignoring her section.. it didnt even look like she was working anymore.

The middle eastern fried chicken was a bit too spicy. Wouldn't recommend it if you can't take spicy food.For dessert - the strawberry and gin parfait would do with a little more gin, could hardly taste the gin in it.

The food bill was fine but the wines were cheaper because of ""happy hour pricing"". Well I paid $45.00 for 2 small wine tastings and 1 glass, these were wines included in the happy hour pricing.

"I visited Reds on a Thursday night with friend. It didn't really look busy that night so I felt the service was a bit slow but since we were chatting, it wasn't that horrible. Now, about the food - we ordered a couple of appetizers, the shrimp ceviche and crispy potato flat bread. The ceviche portion a bit small portions since its served on top of tortilla chips but it was tasty. The best was the flat bread, I was expecting something different but this was delicious. I have to warn you though, it's quite heavy but somehow you can't stop eating it. Main course I ordered the special of the day which was rainbow trout with lentils, it was very very good. Dessert, flourless chocolate cake ... It's ... Good in an interesting way. It's like a chocolate mousse but has some peanuts which gives the salty touch and some banana with some caramel ... So it wasn't to die for but good and you keep eating it trying to figure out what it is that other ingredient, if you know what I mean ;) Overall it was a good experience, good food and ok service.

"I dine weekly at any of the restaurants by Sir Crop, the management company that owns Red's. I spend over $800 a month at their restaurants and have always received good to excellent service. So I was very much looking forward to a Friday night out with a bottle of wine at Red's. What an absolute disappointment.We ordered our favorite, a Kermit Lynch Cote-du Rhone that was selling at an extremely good price ($42) as we typically pay over $60 for this bottle in Yorkville. It was disappointing to learn, 10 minutes later, that this wine was out of stock. Our waiter then mentioned they were out of 3 additional bottles, and after he pointed out which ones, we proceeded to order a different bottle of wine from Italy as well as some food. Imagine our surprise when he came back another 10 minutes later to tell us, that this bottle too, was out of stock. After asking him to check his cellar and come back, something he refused to do and insisted that they had all the other wines, we finally ordered a 3rd bottle. Few minutes pass and he comes back with a bottle. We take a look at it, and realize he has brought the wrong wine from a totally different Region (we ordered a European wine and he bought us one from Argentina). We point this out to him, and please note, it has now been 30 minutes and we have no food or wine. He goes to the bar and then comes back saying that this 3rd bottle is also sold out so they just substituted it to a different bottle! Rightfully so, I got angry and asked to speak to their manager. Their manager, whom I will not name, came over to us with a smirk on his face. I assume he thought we were students looking for a hand out. He leaned over our table, put his chin on his hands, and asked us what he could do for us. I re-iterated the story and the entire time he was just smirking away and not really caring about what we said. Not once did he apologize, he just made excuses and told us to give him 7-10 minutes to see what he had in his cellar. Within a munute he comes back with our original Cote-Du-Rhone! At this point, we wer done and asked to leave. Rather then apologizing, he just said ‘Are you sure you want to leave? I will comp this bottle which should make you happy’. That was just adding insult to the injury here and we walked out.I received a survey asking me to rate my experience and I gave it a 0. I e-mailed back and forth with their Regional manager who apologized and made excuses and finally offered me a free dinner with a bottle of wine as well as a personal apology on the day we go there. I finally agreed to this as I thought he was trying. So when I gave him a date, imagine how I felt when he said he will e-mail a $50 gift card to the restaurant of my choiceThey do not value customers. If they did, they would genuinely try to apologize, and if management is saying I will be there personally to greet you and dinner with wine is on me, why are you sending in a gift card and then capping dinner? The restaurant we chose - minimum we have ever spent there is $160!! We declined his offer, as again, we wanted to bring attention to the service issues and get a proper apology, not a freebie. I will be thinking twice before I ever go into any of Sir Corp restaurants again will make sure I tell everyone of my experience.",1.0,2015-06-22,TripAdvisor

"The wife and I ate here twice on out recent visit to Toronto. Had the Rib eye the first night. Done to perfection(rare). Plenty on the plate at a very good price, Very big range of choices on the menu With 3 courses each and some drinks we paid about 90 dollars, Canadian,(£45) on the two evenings. Very friendly staff, warm welcome, fast service, You don't have to wait long for the food to arrive, but you don't feel rushed.

Ate here for a birthday celebration. Staff was friendly. Server was prompt and friendly. Decor is nice--wood. Location is great at the corner of Gerrard and Yonge. Equidistant between Dundas and College subway stations. Everyone enjoyed their food. I had the Tuna Ahi Nicoise: very tasty and fresh. My dad had the rib-eye steak with chips (fries) for $21.95--it was done to perfection and the chips were great. The others loved their meals too. Server brought dessert with a sparkler and let us sing Happy B-Day at our discretion (no embarrassing group staff sing alongs). Only slight annoyance was the music--a little loud and dance clubbish for me but then again I'm very picky about my music.,4.0,2015-06-14,TripAdvisor

After it taking lots of effort to order drinks we then had 4 differnt waiters come up and push us to order food. even when we said we hadnt really looked yet we were being suggested food. inbetween be3ing pushed to order food and freezing (when i say cold we had thurmals singlet shirt jumper snowjacket on) we looked at the menu and nothing on it looked warm or appealing. after the fith suggestion of what we should eat id had enough paid for our drinks and went accross the road to the elephent where we had eaten the night before. and how great that was it was warm cosy nice staff and good drinks.,1.0,2015-06-08,TripAdvisor

Instead, he went through the entire menu and told me what I could have and subs I could make to have other items. There were a lot of options!!

"We ate here because my husband wanted to try the local fish special written on the chalkboard outside...I wanted sushi. When we ordered, he found out that the fish and salmon had sold out, so he got roast chicken. I didn't see anything exciting on the menu, so I got the classic cheeseburger. He liked the chicken (it was juicy and not dry) and he really enjoyed the roasted shallots that it came with.My cheeseburger was not too appealing..nothing special about it; however, the seasoned fries that came with it were very tasty, and more enjoyable than the burger . For $16.95, the cheeseburger was a normal size....I had thought it would be bigger, for example, Whopper-sized.We also had the Panang coconut chicken soup which was terrible!!! My husband says to ""don't even think about ordering it"". It was tasteless with 2-3 miniature cubes of chicken....I would not recommend this at all. Since we paid $8.95 for it, I managed to somehow swallow the rest of it without trying to taste it. I'm sure you can get tastier food for the money elsewhere.",3.0,2015-05-17,TripAdvisor

The waiter we had was excellent and he looked after us very well (he suggested a good bottle of wine which we enjoyed greatly).

Most restaurants I went to told me to order pop or milk when I made this request, which annoyed me, being pregnant I like to have a 'fancy' drink once and a while. This was a great restaurant for steak. I had the Oscar Sirloin and my husband had the Lobster Sirloin. The steaks were perfect, not too large and served with Caesar Salad which was pretty good.

The flavor of the lobster was unfortunately obscured by the fresh guacamole and salty,?home made? chips. I chose the cioppino which was very good and my wife had the calamari appetizer.

"Reds Midtown Tavern aka Reds Wine Tavern is located at the northwest corner of Yonge and Gerrard Streets, just across the street from the Delta Hotel, so right in the heart of downtown Toronto.One of the taglines on their web site refers to 'Trendy Shareables and Cocktails', and this casual restaurant does cater to the younger Torontonian or visitor, with rather loud music and hip-looking young servers. Our decidedly unhip group of four arrived on a Wednesday evening around 6 pm without a reservation, but after some consideration we were very kindly shown a table on the second level.Service was good, although it did slow down a bit as the place got progressively busier during our meal. But we were not in a rush, so not a problem.Reds has a smallish but interesting-looking menu, bearing in mind that with menus less is generally more because it typically reflects a focus on quality. Reds was also featuring their 'Winterlicious' prix fixe menu, a promotional activity at many downtown Toronto restaurants at this time of year.Most of us selected from the Winterlicious menu. I had the Sweet Potato and Smoked Bacon Soup, Yuzawa Shrimp with Rice, and the Potted Blueberry Cheesecake. This is $25 all in, so an extremely reasonable price.I enjoyed the flavour and texture of the soup. It was served not very hot, and I do not know if that was a feature or a bug. I would have preferred it warmer.The Yuzawa Shrimp features an interesting chili and citrus sauce which was something new for me. It has a little bit of a kick but is not overwhelming. Again, I found this dish served not very hot. The beans were okay and the rice was fine. The portion was not large, so a starter is definitely a good idea.The cheesecake was served in a glass, so an interesting and attractive presentation. Hipness was in evidence, as the 'crust' at the bottom of the glass consisted of loose graham cracker crumbs that were a little dry. But overall enjoyable.I would definitely recommend Reds, and am interested in returning to try a few more of their dishes.",4.0,2015-02-16,TripAdvisor

The brioche buns and the burgers were complementing each other ideally. The calamari platter was prepared with a twist. The chef had the brilliant idea to deep fried lemon rings and rosemary leaves as well giving that classic dish a incredible savour.My guest had the chicken tandoori which according to him was one of the best that he ever had. I chose the daily catch which was small fishes slightly fried served with chickpeas, capers and kalamata olives on a bed of pesto. Delicious, a tad too salty for my taste though.

We have a party of five so we are comfortably seated in a nice corner with enough room even with winter coats. The service was good and efficient. The server was nice even though she does not seem to be very knowledgeable about the menu so maybe a bit more training on the menu. I had the umami burger which is adequate but not remarkable since it is touted to be savory with the fifth taste, therefore its name, umami. It is just a nice burger with sun dried tomato and a nice hamburger bun. The kale salad on the other hand, is delicious and I honestly have an umami moment just eating the side salad since it was so good...It is a nice place for lunch but I would rate it as average.

"I’m a regular at Reds…I’m from the UK but regularly travel to Toronto on business. I always stay at the Eaton Chelsea hotel over the road from Reds but go in pretty much every day. The staff are super friendly and always always make you feel welcome. Not used to that in the UK I have to say. In particular Jen and Phil are normally working when I’m there, are great and always look after me and know what food and drinks I like. Its really become my local while I’m away. The menu is really varied, excellent quality and there is always something I want to eat whether its their kale and quinoa salad or their burger or carbonara. The Mushroom soup is awesome and for dessert the carrot cake is a must. The fish specials are always great too. To drink I am a big fan of Gin and would definitely recommend their design your own, really exceptional. They also have a good selection of beers, boneshaker is my personal favourite. There will always be someone on the door to greet you with a smile and I wasn’t going there for long before I felt like a friend of the place and got very personal treatment for example hosts always remembered I liked a table with a plug so I can work.

"Second time dinning at Reds Midtown Tavern and it did not disappoint. Went with 5 other friends and was sat beside the bar, overlooking Yonge street.Our server (Nicole) and was very attentive and helpful throughout the night. Great gin and tonic selections. I ordered one for myself first, then everyone decided to get one as well since they were so neat. They came in fancy glasses and there were many choices to choose from, together with an interesting ""botanical"" condiment.For food, we had the lobster guacamole, wings, calamari and flat bread. Lobster guacamole tasted decent, with big chunks of lobster. The server even asked if we would like more chips since we finished all the lobster and there were still half a plate of guacamole left. Calamari were delicious, but a little smaller than my fist visit. But it was still crispy with the right amount of spice and the red aioli that goes so well with it. The wings were yum! It was so good we had to order seconds!!! The sauce was creamy, tangy and spicy. Perfect balance. The one dish we must order when dining here is the flat bread. It is the perfect finger food to share or watch a nice sports game with a pint of cold one. Its crispy, creamy tangy, slightly spicy, sweet garlicky... To die for.For mains we went for the 3 big rib eye, lamb shank and their daily catch fish special. All out steaks were cooked perfectly, juicy, tender and it made the plate look small since the portion was huge. I didn't try the lamb shank since my friend devoured it and said it was great. The swordfish was the clear winner. It came with a sweet mixture if mushroom and sesame aioli (I think?). The swordfish was ""wild Nova Scotia harpooned"". It packed a light spicyness to it and was grilled to perfection, not dry and not too rare.Dessert choices were very limited but we were all full by then. We ordered the carrot cake and toffee pudding to share. I didn't get a chance to enjoy the desserts since I was stuffed. But would definitely come back again.",5.0,2014-12-02,TripAdvisor

The portion sizes were perfect; not too much as many restaurants tend to provide. The washrooms were clean. I would definitely return.,4.0,2014-05-28,TripAdvisor
"I am a regular customer at Reds original in First Canadian Place and it's always really good. Reds Midtown was not a good experience. Entrance on Gerrard is dark and there's no greeter. I was seated by a pleasant server but no menu, no wine list, no table setting and no mention of specials. After about 10 minutes of no indication of an intention to give me a menu or take a drink order, I left. Even Denny's gives you a menu when you sit down. Very unprofessional.",1.0,2014-05-11,TripAdvisor
"A bunch of us went to REDS at Gerrard and Yonge (in Toronto, for those of you who aren't from our neck of the woods!). The occasion was a big office luncheon.I'm a foodie. I love food so I guess I'm a bit fussy and my reviews about restaurants can be a bit tough ... however, the experience at Reds was really great from start to finish. Allow me to elaborate a bit:Décor - (yeah, this is important to me!) It's a gorgeous restaurant. Very beautifully decorated with unique lighting and attention to detail. We had a smaller room off to the side for our party of 16, and it was really nice.Service - Very friendly and prompt. We were a big group and the waiter didn't mess up any orders and didn't forget any side dishes! Food - Great menu, lots to choose from although it's a tad pricey compared to other restaurants for a lunch. The lunch prices might turn some people off to dining there, but please try it once! Nice spot. I had a focaccia turkey peameal sandwich with fries and it was amazing. Next time I'm going to try the lettuce wraps or the salmon. The portions are generous and nobody should leave there hungry.There are chicken dishes, pasta dishes, salads, burgers, enough for everyone to find something they'd like. I haven't seen the dinner menu so I don't know if it is the same as the lunch menu. My guess is the dinner menu might be a tad more expensive but I can't say for sure. Would I go back? Yup ... in fact, my best friend's birthday is fast approaching and I think I might take her there for her birthday dinner. It's in a great location, just south of College subway station and downstairs from a Marshall's and Bed, Bath and Beyond (hey ... if you're enjoying a day of shopping, these issues matter! ;) ) The only negative (if this is a negative, I don't know, depends on whom you speak with) ... during lunch they played music kind of loudly. If they'd turned it down just a notch or two it would have been the perfect experience. The restaurant doesn't have much of a view ... you're right on Gerrard just off of Yonge Street (not the prettiest area of Toronto for sure) but the ambiance (except loud music) makes up for that for sure.One thing to mention and I'm sure you know this but I'll mention it here just as an FYI - for groups of 6 or more (or maybe it was 8 or more, can't remember) they automatically add the tip on your bill, so please watch for that and don't doubt tip (unless you are feeling really generous, LOL!)",5.0,2014-04-13,TripAdvisor

"We came here for a post work dinner with friends. The decor is interesting - love all the lights - and the food was really great. We had the lobster guacamole to share whilst we deliberated the mains and it was delicious. The staff were courteous, helpful and there just when you needed them. The food was really well done - my tuna was cooked to perfection - and the wine delicious! I would definitely come back here. The only drawbacks were the TVs and very loud music downstairs.",4.0,2014-02-21,TripAdvisor
"Celebrated my birthday with a group of friends on Saturday night. Our waitress was excellent, friendly and attentive to our needs. The food and drinks were delicious! I had champagne, calamari and the grilled cheese. All were excellent. Received special treatment for my birthday including a personalized treat and card from the Reds team staff. Had a lovely night.",5.0,2014-02-16,TripAdvisor

"We love Reds on Adelaide so when we heard about Reds Midtown we had to try it out.Conveniently located at Yonge and Gerrard across the street from the Eaton Chelsea, this new Reds is a chop off the old block to the one on Gerrard. Similar décor, rustic, chic warehouse style. Although somewhat quiet (it was 2:00 in the afternoon), we enjoyed the ambience. Staff were super friendly and efficient. We shared a couple of dishes as we usually do. Lobster Guacamole was excellent and the sliders were delicious and filling. A great addition to the Toronto restaurant scene, although the location seems a bit south to be called ""Midtown"". We'll be back!",4.0,2014-01-06,TripAdvisor
"We have been enjoying some fantastic meals at Red's Wine Bar, so when we heard they opened a new location we were excited to try it. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and we loved the atmosphere. The menu is a repeat of the original location, which immediately produces thoughts of the same food, as well. The food was not the same and neither was the service. We experienced a lot of confusion and our ""server"" was replaced several times. Additionally, we were disappointed with the food quality, which usually does not happen in the original location. I think they need a little more time to work out the ""kinks"" and we will probably visit them again in several months.",3.0,2014-01-01,TripAdvisor
"My boyfriend and I decided to try the Red's wine Tavern (midtown) during our little trip to Toronto. We were welcomed with 2 glass of sparkling wine, thanks again for that sweet attention! The servicewas excellent from the beggining to the end. We asked a lot of questions about the menu and the wine list and everything was well answered. I really like the tuna tataki and the seafood stew. I will definitely come back :-) Thanks to the wonderful team at Red's Midtown!",5.0,2014-01-01,TripAdvisor
"My husband and i went as a last minute trip to Toronto and ended up here for dinner. It is a newly built but feels old place, with brick walls and an industrial chic kinda feel. There was plenty of room both upstairs and on the main floor - we sat on the main floor near the window - which i will confess was a bit chilly. Our waitress was very friendly and full of recommendations (and even directions later on for lost travellers). The wine was very tasty and the food arrived quickly and hot. My husband had the rib eye steak which was cooked exactly the way he wanted it and was very tasty, while i enjoyed the filet mignon - which was likewise cooked with a delicious glaze which enhanced the natural deliciousness of the meat. Accompanied by fries with truffle seasoning and a kale salad, we definitely had enough on our plates to fill us up. The lighting was also neat - with plenty of retro lighting to ensure we could see each other and our food!",4.0,2013-12-28,TripAdvisor
"Went there for drinks and apps. Food was ok, but the service was unfriendly and cold. We sat at the bar and the bartender was more interested in her phone and other staff than taking care of the Guest. Never did a food quality check and let our drinks run dry. The room was only 1/4 full so there was plenty of opportunity for her to engage us.",3.0,2013-12-27,TripAdvisor
"I was part of a group of colleagues,all in Toronto on business, who looking for a convenient place to meet selected Reds. What a great choice. The atmosphere is fun with a cosmopolitan decor that made us feel we were part of Toronto downtown life. The wine selection was outstanding and the group ordered some interesting appetizers.Everyone had different dinner plans but the next time I am in Toronto I will stay for dinner- the menu had some great options.",5.0,2013-12-13,TripAdvisor
"Our office held an afternoon/evening get together here. Aesthetically, this is a beautiful restaurant, well-lit, with comfortable stools, non-intrusive tv screens, and unusual light fixtures. The place got noisy as afternoon turned into evening; but there is a quieter area on the second floor, where the washrooms are (quite a climb): and a glassed-in private dining room at the main entrance. Staff are young and pleasant. There is a great selection of beer and wines, by the glass and bottled. We had a variety of pre-ordered finger-foods, served to our group en masse, with varying results. The wings were over-spiced, coated in an odd cream sauce (heartburn resulted later that night), and the veggies and dip did not justify their cost. Sliders, charcuterie and calamari were ok. The potato flatbread was the best item, and the only really unique one. Overall, dining here was a pleasant experience, but for the upscale cost, the food could be better. I wouldn't hestitate to go here to enjoy the bar, however - it's great.",3.0,2013-12-12,TripAdvisor
"Went for a business lunch with some co-workers. I agree with one of the other posters that it is fairly noisy in the restaurant so not that easy to have a work conversation. We were downstairs, so I can not say if the upstairs would be quieter. I didn't venture up there. If you are a group of 8 or 10 you could be seated in the separate room by the front door which would give would most certainly give you a quieter setting to have a conversation, however be aware that it has a glass partition so that everyone coming in and out of the restaurant will be able to see you. As for the food, we each ordered something different and were happy with what we ate but I found it a pricey for what you got. Maybe it was the choices we made -- perhaps we should have stuck to the sandwich choices. I'm guessing the prices are same as their other location which is in the financial district where people are on expense accounts and have fatter wallets.I found the service slow, but that could just be because they are new and it was very busy that day. So on another visit that might be fine. We were close to the front and it was weird watching the hostesses roaming the floor and peering into the dining room while looking up and down at their seating charts on their ipads. Distracting to me as a diner. They need to find a better way to keep on top of what tables are free. (sometimes technology is a bad thing).I found that you sit too low in the chairs for the table height. This seems to be a regular thing at a lot a restaurants lately. I found the same at a place in Yorkville recently, I guess the guys buying the furniture are 6 feet tall and that seating height works for them. With the type of bowl/plate the food came in, I found I was reaching up to get into my lunch, just compounded the issue. Awkward. Not much they can do about that now though with the tables and chairs bought. If I went again I might try sitting in the bar area instead.Overall the atmosphere is nice, and restaurant is visually appealing -- there isn't really anything contemporary like it in the neighbourhood so I think it will do well. To me, it is somewhere to go for drinks and dinner after work when you don't care about the noise level.",3.0,2013-12-08,TripAdvisor
"Had dinner here with my son in Toronto the night of the Gray Cup final, but was able to get a seat. Excellent beer and food. Had the roast chicken which was crispy and very good. My son had the chicken club sandwich, which was tasty, and great fries. A bit on the higher priced side, but given the neighborhood, service and decir, it was well worth it.",4.0,2013-11-30,TripAdvisor
"Visited Toronto for 6 days went to Reds twice. Once for drinks and the second time for food. The staff were friendly and inviting from the hostess to the manager!

Thanks Tyson, Mike and the sweet little hostess who came and invited us in off the street....you made our visit!",5.0,2013-11-22,TripAdvisor
"A friend and I waited months for Reds to open and decided to have a go....It is a lavish and expensive Tavern corner of Young and Gerrard.. We sat upstairs were they said it would be less noisy...we could barely hear each other...so a relaxed conversation was out of the question. The menu had wonderfully descriptive entries which didn't match up to the food we ordered. I ordered their Ultra Special Burger...the ultimate. It was two very slim fried burgers which together would make one normal burger, a very tiny slice of tomato, three or four rings of raw onion, piece of lettuce and a toasted bun. There burger tasted like it had no seasoning at all...just fried hamburger...the skimpy toppings were nothing to rave about. My fried had creamed curry dish and he said it was chicken in a cream sauce but he felt they forget to put the curry spice in it...very bland in his opinion. I wouldn't recommend either of these until they find a chef with a recipe book. Johnny Rocket burger 100 times better. I will say a lady near by had the quite expensive fillet mignon and it looked fab. charred on the outside wonderfully rare inside and she cut it with ease...definitely the way to go but it costs. The wine we chose was great, the service was great...I just wish we could have phoned for delivery. Bring spices if you want a burger.",3.0,2013-11-15,TripAdvisor
"Being I work within the complex where this new Reds location just opened up, I have to say they have a for sure hit here. On the street level at Yonge & Gerrard inside the new Shops At Aura complex that is attatched to College Park, the foot traffic will bring people in for sure. The area does not have enough choices of places to eat or go for drinks unless you venture down Yonge to Dundas. But this place definitely is worth going to. Beautiful interior, they have a really great selection of wines and beers. The food, if you like Jack Astor's, Canyon Creek or Alice Fazooli's then you will know the food is great. One thing that stands out is the staff. Very friendly staff who will go over the menu with you and re personable. We had Mike serving us nd he was the bomb. Fun and friendly. Just the way I like to encounter staff where I go out for drinks and/or food.When you go there ask for Billy the Manager, great guy who again is personable and friendly. Wait until Spring/Summer when they get their patio up and running, location is perfect!",5.0,2013-11-13,TripAdvisor
